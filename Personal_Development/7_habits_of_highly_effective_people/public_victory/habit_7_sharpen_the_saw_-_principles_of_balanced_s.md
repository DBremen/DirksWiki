## Habit 7: Sharpen the Saw - Principles of Balanced Self-Renewal {#habit-7-sharpen-the-saw-principles-of-balanced-self-renewal}

Habit 7 is personal PC. It&#039;s preserving and enhancing the greatest asset you have -- you. It&#039;s renewing the four dimensions of your nature -- physical, spiritual, mental, and social/emotional. Although different words are used, most philosophies of life deal either explicitly or implicitly with these four dimensions. Philosopher Herb Shepherd describes the healthy balanced life around four values: perspective (spiritual), autonomy (mental), connectedness (social), and tone (physical). George Sheehan, the running guru, describes four roles: being a good animal (physical), a good craftsman (mental), a good friend (social), and a saint (spiritual). Sound motivation and organization theory embrace these four dimensions or motivations -- the economic (physical); how people are treated (social); how people are developed and used (mental); and the service, the job, the contribution the organization gives (spiritual). &quot;Sharpen the Saw&quot; basically means expressing all four motivations. It means exercising all four dimensions of our nature, regularly and consistently, in wise and balanced ways.
