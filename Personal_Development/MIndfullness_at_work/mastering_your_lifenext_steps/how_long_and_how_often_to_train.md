## How Long and How Often to Train {#how-long-and-how-often-to-train}

In my experience of guiding many people from a wide range of cultures, a minimum of ten minutes a day of mindfulness training ensures good results. As you gradually develop, you can increase the duration as much as you like. The more you do it, the more youâ€™ll get out of it. Just like with physical exercise, more time spent training equates to greater outcomes.

In terms of frequency, I recommend you set aside time every day to practice. Daily training is the best way to get results. When you do it every day, it will become a habit.

In my experience, the morning is a good time for most people. The mind is fresh, and therefore you get more out of the training. In addition, when you spend ten minutes at the start of the day to consciously be focused and aware, it has a strong influence on the rest of the day.
