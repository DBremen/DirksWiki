## Patience {#patience}

**“A moment of patience in a moment of anger saves you a thousand moments of regret.”**

Patience involves choosing to stay calm in the face of challenging situations, even when our fight or flight reflex might already be triggered. It’s the ability to endure unpleasantness, to confront the situation directly and handle it sensibly, rather than on impulse. Patience is more concerned with larger goals than temporary, quick-fix solutions.

Patience is the direct path to living a more effective life that’s focused on the roots of problems instead of the symptoms.
