## Joy {#joy}

Joy boosts our energy and performance; it enhances our ability to do good work and excel at business. Like all feelings, joy is something we can enable inside ourselves. Our nervous system reacts to our state of mind. What we feel mentally has a significant effect on our physical body.

Quite simply, joy equates to taking better care of both body and mind. When weâ€™re happy doing something, we expand both our mental and physical resources.
