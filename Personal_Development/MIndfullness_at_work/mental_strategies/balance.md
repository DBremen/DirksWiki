## Balance {#balance}

When you stop yourself from following an impulse—say, quitting after one serving of your favorite food or drink—serotonin balances out the dopamine release. In your daily mindfulness training, you’re constantly resisting impulses to follow distracting thoughts or hold onto stress.

Consciously identify the tasks at work that bring your instant gratification—say answering an e-mail or text. Now identify the tasks that bring discomfort. This may be fielding com- plaints from customers or confronting a surly coworker. Be aware of your reactions to these tasks and temper those reac- tions by purposefully limiting or delaying the gratification of the experiences you like, while more actively confronting the experiences you dislike.

You train balance by being aware of your reaction to everything you experience, good, bad, and neutral. Notice the experiences you like and those you do not like, things where you experience attraction and things where you experience aversion. Just being aware of these reactions will lead to change. When you become aware of a desire, the desire will lessen as it’s replaced by awareness of the desire. When you become aware of resistance, the resistance will lessen as it’s replaced by awareness of it. If something is pleasant and nice, you observe it neutrally without giving it more value or holding onto it. If something is unpleasant, you observe it neutrally without wanting it to disappear.
