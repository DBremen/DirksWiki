## Communication {#communication}

The foundation of mindful communication is, as in many other aspects of life, being fully present in your interactions with other people. Only when we’re fully present do we get the most out of our time together. And only when we’re fully present can we be sure to under- stand what’s actually being communicated.

Empathy—being in tune with the feelings of others—plays a major role in effective communication. If you have a sense of how the person with whom you’re trying to communicate feels, it’s easier to get on their wavelength.

From a neurological perspective, two fundamental tendencies in the human mind create barriers to effective communication. First, there’s the reality of the mind’s natural tendency to wander. The second tendency is our mind’s orientation to see things as we expect to see them, commonly known as habitual perception. Habitual perception or cognitive rigidity as it’s also known—is the mind’s natural desire to place reality into simple, pre-existing categories. This causes us to believe the mind’s own limited projections about other people, ourselves, and all the things we encounter. Thus we are being cognitively rigid when we limit our perceptions. Both our wandering minds and this rigidity severely hinder our ability to communicate.
