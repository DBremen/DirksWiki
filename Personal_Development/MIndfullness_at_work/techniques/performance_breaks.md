## Performance breaks {#performance-breaks}

A mindful performance break is basically a very brief mindfulness training session. And by brief, I mean about 45 seconds. To take mind- ful performance breaks, try this, once every hour during work.

*   Let go of your activities. You donâ€™t need to go anywhere special.
*   Close your eyes or keep them open, whichever you prefer. Direct your full attention to your breath. For three breath cycles do the following:
    *   Breathe in while noticing your breath breathe out while relaxing your shoulders, neck, and arms.
    *   Breathe in while focusing fully on your inhale; breathe out while focusing on the exhale.
    *   Breathe in while enhancing the clarity of your attention; breathe out while maintaining clarity.
*   Let go of the exercise. Return to your work with renewed relaxation, focus, and clarity.
