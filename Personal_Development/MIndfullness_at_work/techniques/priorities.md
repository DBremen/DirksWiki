### Action Addiction {#action-addiction}

Addiction to action is one of the biggest threats to mental effectiveness and productivity. The root cause of action addition is an untrained mind. A well-trained mind is the only way to overcome it. The tasks are in front of us, and we want to be useful and productive. The problem is, when we don’t step back to ensure we’re spending time on tasks aligned with our main goals, we end up wasting a lot of time on immediate— though often inessential—tasks.

Focus your effort on the 20% that produce 80% of your output.

### Choice points – when priorities conflict {#choice-points-when-priorities-conflict}

Conflicting priorities are the most common causes of action addiction. When two or more priorities conflict, you reach a choice point: a point at which you need to decide how to best manage multiple priorities or competing urgencies.

We often react to choice points by jumping into action. There it is again, that action addiction. But, as you now know, not all action is aligned with our goals. When priorities conflict, take a breath before you jump into action. Endure the discomfort of conflicting priorities.

### Speed Up by Slowing Down {#speed-up-by-slowing-down}

By taking a brief pause, you’re able to maintain your focus and awareness. This allows you to respond to situations with the most appropriate action—to concentrate on your priorities and goals—rather than simply acting on autopilot.
