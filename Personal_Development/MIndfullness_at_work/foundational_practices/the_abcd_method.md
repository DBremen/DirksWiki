## The ABCD Method {#the-abcd-method}

Mindfulness training is not passive. It’s an active intervention in your brain’s neural network. For every moment you maintain focus, you create new “focus” neural connections and abilities. Thanks to neuroplasticity, the more you train, the stronger these neural connections and pathways become—and the easier it becomes to stay focused.

### Anatomy: Finding the Right Posture {#anatomy-finding-the-right-posture}

Sit on a chair with both feet planted firmly on the floor.

Find balance. Don’t lean back, forward, or to either side.

Sit with your back straight, but relaxed. Sitting up straight will help you to stay awake and alert.

Relax your body as much as you can. Pay special attention to your neck, shoulders, and arms—the places where many of us carry tension. Take time to release any tension you may feel. If it helps, roll your neck or move your shoulders up and down a few times. Also, take a deep breath and relax as you breathe out.

Place your hands on your knees or in your lap.

Close your eyes. If you start to doze off, open your eyes a little. Letting a small amount of light in activates your nervous sys- tem. If you opt to keep your eyes open, look down at the floor in front of you with a soft gaze.

Breathe in and out through your nose.

You may find it helps to scan your body for tension, releasing it every- where you notice it, for the first few minutes of your training—or as long as it takes to feel alert but relaxed. In this way, you will gradually develop a more relaxed body. And a more relaxed body lays the groundwork for a more relaxed mind, both prerequisites for training sharp focus.

### Breathing: The Anchor for Attention {#breathing-the-anchor-for-attention}

*   Focus your full attention on the experience of breathing. Be aware of how your stomach expands when you breathe in and contracts when you breathe out.
*   If focusing on your belly doesn’t feel natural, try observing your breathing at the nostrils. Pay attention to the air flowing in and out of your nose.
*   Let the observation of your breath be neutral and effortless. You don’t need to breathe deeply or slowly. You don’t need to manipulate or change it. You don’t have to get involved in it in any way. Observe it in the same way you would waves rolling in to beach. You don’t try to control the waves—you just watch. While it can be challenging, neutral observation is very important as we go further into the training.

### Counting for Focus {#counting-for-focus}

*   Breathe in. Breathe out. When you finish breathing out, count “one.” A short and succinct mental count. Breathe in again, out again, and count “two.” Carry on in the same way until you get to ten, then count backward to one. Repeat this cycle

If you have trouble counting higher than three or seven without losing focus, don’t worry. The point of counting is not to see how many times you get through the cycle; rather, it’s a tool to help you maintain focus.

If you suddenly find yourself at, you’ve been counting on autopilot and are not managing your attention. Start again at one. In the same way, if you find you’ve stopped counting altogether, simply start again at one.

If you find thoughts sneaking in between numbers, that’s a sign you’re not fully focused on your breath. Sharpen your focus on your breath and give it your full attention, in a relaxed manner.

If counting, or any other specific tactic gets in the way, don’t get upset. Instead, be grateful that you’ve recognized what doesn’t work for you and see it as an opportunity to make your own training more effective.

### Distractions: Relax, Release, Return {#distractions-relax-release-return}

Distractions are your best friends in focus training. Distractions are the ones telling you when you are off track. What is a distraction? Basically anything that is not your breath is a distraction. And they can come from six sources: smell, taste, bodily sensations, sight, sounds, and the mind itself. Regardless of where the distraction comes from, the instructions for dealing with it are the same: Relax, Release, and Return.

*   Relax: When you perceive you are distracted by a thought, sound, or sensation, notice whether it creates any tension any- where in your body. Try your best to release that tension. Relax. Recognize the fact that you have been distracted. It’s really not the end of the world. Instead of getting frustrated or annoyed, think of that distraction as a good friend—one who gently reminds you that your attention has drifted. Treat every time you notice yourself being distracted as a moment to celebrate. After all, when you are aware that your mind has drifted, you are being mindful!
*   Release: Release whatever distraction you may encounter, simply by redirecting your focus toward your breath. Your full focus One Second Ahead can only be in one place at a time. If you choose your breath, the distraction is gradually released. Let go of the distraction gratefully, it helped you notice the fact that you had lost track of your breathing.
*   Return: Once you have released the distraction and regained a sense of relaxation, come back to your breathing with renewed focus and awareness.

You’ll likely find focus training is a continual back and forth between paying attention to your breathing and being distracted. Some days, there will be more distractions than focus. Other days, there will be more focus than distraction.

Remember, the objective is not to sit without distractions. If it were, none of us would succeed. The objective is to be aware of the fact that you’re distracted and to acknowledge that you have the ability to regain your focus on your breath. It’s the conscious placing of our attention that’s critical to training sharp focus.
