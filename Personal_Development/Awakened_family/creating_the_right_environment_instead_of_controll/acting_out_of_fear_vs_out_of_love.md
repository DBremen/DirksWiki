## Acting out of fear vs. out of love {#acting-out-of-fear-vs-out-of-love}

We have all experienced moments of sheer panic, when our reactions are all about fear-laden control, as opposed to understanding and connection. Our children stay awake doing homework, but our fear that they won’t get enough sleep causes us to bark or yell at them instead of empathizing with them. Or our child doesn’t manage to master the skill of potty training on time, but instead of entering deep patience and teaching them this skill, we find ourselves riddled with fear that they will be rejected from kindergarten and will wither away at home, isolated and friendless.

**~ The Gift ~**

May you be blessed with a child . . .

Who defies you

So you learn to release control,

With one who doesn’t listen

So you learn to tune in,

With one who loves to procrastinate

So you learn the beauty of stillness,

With one who forgets things

So you learn to let go of attachments,

With one who is extra-sensitive

So you learn to be grounded,

With one who is inattentive

So you learn to be focused,

With one who dares to rebel

So you learn to think outside the box,

With one who feels afraid

So you learn to trust the universe.

May you be blessed with a child . . .

Who teaches you

That it is never about them

And all about you.
