## Pushing and bad intentions {#pushing-and-bad-intentions}

We push our children much more than they ever push us. For instance, when does a child ever start each day with lists and schedules as we do? They don’t make a zillion plans for us and force us to go places we don’t want to go. They don’t threaten us when we don’t eat the food they like or don’t wear the clothes they choose for us. It’s we who initiate such dynamics, rigidly forcing on them our standards. Naturally, we couch these things in terms such as giving them opportunities, promoting good health, exposing them to life’s possibilities, and showing our support for them. If we were honest with ourselves, we would admit that all of this is just manipulation so we can get our way.

When we understand that less-than-desirable behavior is a signal of something else, we are reminded to connect with our children in a more meaningful manner. When we view their behavior through the lens of cause and effect, instead of rushing to judgment about their character, we become curious about their feelings and experiences. This approach does wonders in terms of building trust and thereby drawing our children closer to us.

**Instead of attempting to get our children to change, the challenge is to transform our energy from a state of neediness to one of empowerment based on an awareness of the abundance at our disposal. By asking, “Can I become what I need my children to be?” we start to embody the qualities we wish them to absorb. To shift from believing that life happens to us, to understanding that life happens for us and with our participation, enables us to find the jewel in every experience**

Our instinct is to lash out. If someone irritates us, we don’t think twice but simply react. “Hey, what’s wrong with you? Can you stop what you are doing?” It doesn’t occur to us to say, “Why am I getting so agitated right now? Can I communicate my needs in a respectful manner knowing that the other is not coming from a place of evil intention? Can I remove myself from this situation if it feels unbearable?

**~ A New Commitment to Shedding the Past ~**

Even though I want to cling to what ought to be

And all the ways life should have been,

I know that my resistance to what is

Comes from fear,

Which blinds me to the jewels of the present moment.

If I can let go of my need to control

I can enter the unknown with vigor.

Flowing with grit, resilience, and power,

I can become the agent

Of the transformation I wish to witness.

Resisting nothing,

I greet the present moment with awareness and joy.
