# Conscious, mindful, awakened {#conscious-mindful-awakened}

This book holds the vision that every child will stay planted in their true self, for this is their birthright.

We awaken when we become aware of who we truly are. **The mind, then—meaning the beliefs we live by that drive so much of what we think and feel—is the true starting place for change.**

An awakened parent is one who is aware that the traditional paradigms of parenting, where the parent is seen as greater than the child, are obsolete in the modern world, producing dysfunction and disconnection in families. Instead, they are willing to be the architects of a new model of parenthood where parent and child are seen as equal, serving as mutual partners on a path of growth founded on increasing consciousness.

Parents view their children as mirrors through which they are able to see how they themselves need to mature and develop. Instead of fixing what they see as faults in their children, these parents seek to work on themselves, raising their own levels of maturity and presence. **The focus is always on the parent’s awareness rather than the child’s behavior. This is the core insight of the book.**

We act too often through our ego (inner voice, unconsciousness). A child has the ability to bring to our attention just how unconscious much of our parenting is.
