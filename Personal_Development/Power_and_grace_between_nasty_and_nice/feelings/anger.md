Set boundaries, create energy to make change

Violence and rage occur as a reaction to our own fear, hurt, and shame, and indirectly to our loneliness, sadness, or some combination of them all.

The violence and rage that we perpetrate on others happens, not because of something the other person does, but because of something we do not do—that is, control ourselves.

We respond very quickly to what is going on around us and inside of us.

We’re going to feel what we feel whether we think we will or not.

In most cases, once we feel the feelings, Homo sapiens have the great good fortune to be able to choose how we further respond because we have a neocortex.

**What distinguish a mature, intact, integrated person from a less fully developed**, perhaps wounded person. The capacities include the “ability to experience a wide range of feelings deeply,” the “ability to be alone,” and the **“ability to soothe painful feelings.”** The lack of this ability to soothe one’s feelings is implicated in a wide range of mental health problems, but nowhere is its presence as obvious as in addictions and disorders of impulse control, especially rage problems.
