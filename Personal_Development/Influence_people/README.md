_James Harvey Robinson&#039;s enlightening book The Mind in the Making._

_Benjamin Franklin&#039;s autobiography -one of the most fascinating life stories ever written_

_“If out of reading this book you get just one thing - an increased tendency to think always in terms of other people&#039;s point of view, and see things from their angle - if you get that one thing out of this book, it may easily prove to be one of the building blocks of your career.”_

_I had the blues because I had no shoes, until upon the street, I met a man who had no feet.&quot;_

**Fable about the sun and the wind:**

_They quarreled about which was the stronger, and the wind said, &quot;I&#039;ll prove I am. See the old man down there with a coat? I bet I can get his coat off him quicker than you can.&quot;_

_So the sun went behind a cloud, and the wind blew until it was almost a tornado, but the harder it blew, the tighter the old man clutched his coat to him._

_Finally, the wind calmed down and gave up, and then the sun came out from behind the clouds and smiled kindly on the old man. Presently, he mopped his brow and pulled off his coat. The sun then told the wind that gentleness and friendliness were always stronger than fury and force._
