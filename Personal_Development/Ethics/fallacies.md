# Fallacies {#fallacies}

Here’s an example of one of them. Suppose your friend tells you that if God exists, then abortion is immoral. But she proceeds to claim that God doesn’t exist. So, she concludes, abortion is morally OK. Or suppose that someone makes you the following offer: if you buy this item now, then you’ll get 50 percent off. So you think: well, if I don’t buy it now, then I’m not going to get that discount.

if I’m a millionaire, then I have at least ten dollars. (True.)

I’m not a millionaire. (True.)

Therefore, I don’t have ten dollars. (False.)

Premise 1 says that P is a guarantee for Q. Premise 2 says that this guarantee doesn’t hold. What follows? Nothing. That’s because there can be many sufficient conditions for something.

If life is meaningful, then God exists; God does exist; therefore, life is meaningful.

1.  if I’m a millionaire, then I have ten dollars. (True.)
2.  I have ten dollars. (True.)
3.  Therefore, I’m a millionaire
4.  if P, then Q
5.  Q is true
6.  therefore, P is true.
