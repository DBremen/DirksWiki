# Time management matrix {#time-management-matrix}

Incorporate as a weekly exercise to schedule time

Stephen Covey:

The “P/PC Principle”, which instructs that **achieving effectiveness requires balance between production and production capability**. In other words, in order to produce, we need to take care of ourselves.

Spending too much time in quadrant 1 leads to stress, burnout and crisis management, which gradually tends to consume all the time available.

Quadrant 3 is often mistaken for quadrant 1 (since the tasks at hand are urgent, eg. a ringing phone), but in reality the urgency is based on priorities of other people. Spending too much time in quadrant 3 leads to gradual loss of control and long-term vision.

Spending time mostly in quadrants 3 and 4 is pretty much the worst case scenario, with no sense of responsibility or control.

**The aim is to spend as much time as possible in quadrant 2, which is at the core of the effective personal management. While the activities are not urgent, they are important**
