## Process {#process}

By using this tool, you will have no chance but to prioritize. How can you use your time more efficiently? Is there anything you could remove to free up more time? What are the biggest time-wasters? What activities are non-negotiable and need to be included in the chart?

Experiment with being broad and then go more specific, so that you can find what feels more intuitive. Use a combination of both: some activities are “categories” (eg. relationships, self-time, work) and some are very specific (sailing and cycling).

1.  Identify a time period that feels right for you. One year is a good point of reference for long-term planning, but the pie chart can be used on a weekly or monthly basis as well.
2.  Identify activities which you would like to engage in within that time period.
3.  Draw/print the pie chart as a simple circle. Add a section of the pie for the physiological tax.
4.  Divide the remaining time within the pie chart between activities. Think about how you spend your hours, days, and weeks, and how this relates to the time period represented by the whole “pie”.
5.  Repeat steps 2–4 to create a pie chart representing the things you are actually doing _right now_ in your life.
6.  Compare the pie charts. How could you move towards your desired time distribution? What are the time wasters? Which activities can you drop or reduce? How could you free up more time? What needs to change?
