# Pie Chart of time {#pie-chart-of-time}

Identifying the most optimal ways to spend your time.

The time available within the pie chart is limited (unlike in calendars, in which any activity can simply be moved to a different day). Because it reinforces the idea of scarcity, you are forced to prioritize.

The embedded slice represents the time necessary to sleep, eat and take care of physiological needs. I’ve rounded it up to 40% (based on 8 hours of sleep + 1 hour for other needs = 37.5%). It’s a kind of “physiological tax” you have to pay to your body everyday for being alive. The remaining 60% represents the time available to you.
