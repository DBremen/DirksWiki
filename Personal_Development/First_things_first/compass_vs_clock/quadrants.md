*   Quadrant I (Production): represents things that are **both urgent and important**. Here’s where we:
    *   handle an irate client
    *   meet a deadline
    *   repair a broken down machine
    *   undergo heart surgery
    *   Help a crying child who has been hurt.

We need to spend time in Quadrant I. This is where we manage, where we produce, where we bring our experience and judgment to bear in responding too many needs and challenges. If we ignore it, we become buried alive. But we also need to realize that **many important activities become urgent through procrastination, or because we don’t do enough prevention and planning.**

*   **Quadrant II (Increase production capacity):** includes activities that are **important, but not urgent**. This is the Quadrant of Quality. Here’s where we:
    *   do our long-range planning
    *   anticipate and prevent problems
    *   empower others
    *   broaden our minds
    *   increase our skills through reading and continuous professional development
    *   envision how we’re going to help a struggling son or daughter
    *   prepare for important meetings and presentations
    *   invest in relationships through deep, honest listening

**Increasing time spent in this quadrant increases our ability to do. Ignoring this quadrant feeds and enlarges Quadrant I**, creating stress, burnout, and deeper crises for the person consumed by it. **On the other hand, investing in this quadrant shrinks Quadrant I. Planning, preparation, and prevention keep many things from becoming urgent. Quadrant II does not act on us; we must act on it. This is the Quadrant of personal leadership.**

*   **Quadrant III**: is almost the phantom of Quadrant I. It includes things that are **urgent, but not important**. This is the **Quadrant of Deception**. The noise of urgency creates the illusion of importance. But the actual activities, if they’re important at all, are only important to someone else. Many phone calls, meetings, and drop-in visitors fall into this category. **We spend a lot of time in Quadrant III meeting other people’s priorities and expectations, thinking we’re really in Quadrant I.**
*   **Quadrant IV:** is reserved for those activities that are **not urgent and not important**. We get so battle-scarred from being tossed around in Quadrants I and III that we often escape to Quadrant IV for survival. What kinds of things are in Quadrant IV?
    *   Not necessarily recreational things, because recreation in the true sense of recreation is a valuable Quadrant II activity.
    *   reading addictive light novels
    *   habitually watching mindless television shows
    *   gossiping around the water fountain

Quadrant IV is not survival; it’s deterioration. It may have an initial cotton candy feel, but we quickly find there’s nothing there.
