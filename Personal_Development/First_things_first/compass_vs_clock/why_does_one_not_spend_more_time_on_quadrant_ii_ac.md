## Why does one not spend more time on Quadrant II activities? {#why-does-one-not-spend-more-time-on-quadrant-ii-activities}

Because they’re not urgent. They aren’t pressing. They don’t act on you. You have to act on them.

When we operate out of the importance paradigm, we live in Quadrants I and II. We’re out of Quadrants III and IV, and as we spend more time in preparation, prevention, planning, and empowerment, we decrease the amount of time we spend putting out fires in Quadrant I. Even the nature of Quadrant I changes. Most of the time, we’re there by choice rather than default. We may even choose to make something urgent or timely because it’s important.
