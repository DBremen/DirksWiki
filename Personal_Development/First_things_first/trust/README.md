# Trust {#trust}

Both character and competence are necessary to inspire trust. And both are completely within our Circle of Influence.

Character includes:

*   **Integrity** - the ability to walk your talk, a thorough integratedness of public, private, and deep inner life around a balanced set of principles
*   **Majority** - the balance of courage and consideration that enables you to say what needs to be said, to give honest feedback, to address issues in a straightforward way, but with consideration and respect for the feelings, thoughts, and opinions of others
*   **Abundance mentality** - the paradigm that life is ever expanding, that there are an infinite number of third alternatives (in contrast to the paradigm that life is a zero sum game, that the pie is only so large and if anyone else gets a piece, that means less for me)
