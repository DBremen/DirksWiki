## STEP TWO: IDENTIFY YOUR ROLES {#step-two-identify-your-roles}

We live our lives in terms of roles not in the sense of role playing, but in the sense of authentic parts we’ve chosen to fill. We may have important roles at work, in the family, in the community, or in other areas of life. Roles represent responsibilities, relationships, and areas of contribution.

Much of our pain in life comes from the sense that we’re succeeding in one role at the expense of other, possibly even more important roles. We may be doing great as vice president of the company, but not doing well at all as a parent or spouse.

A clear set of roles provides a natural framework to create order and balance. If you have a mission statement, your roles will grow out of it. Balance among roles does not simply mean that you’re spending time in each role, but that these roles work together for the accomplishment of your mission.

Identifying roles gives a sense of the wholeness of quality life that life is more than just a job, or a family, or a particular relationship. It’s all of these together. Identifying roles may also highlight “important, but not urgent” areas that are currently being neglected.

In addition to the roles you’ve identified, we’d like to suggest a separate and foundational role called “sharpen the saw”. We treat this as a separate role for two reasons: 1) it’s a role that everyone has, and 2) it’s foundational for success in every other role.

It’s also important to realize that all of these roles are not distinct “departments” of life. They form a highly interrelated whole. By identifying your roles, you’re not trying to break your life down and fit it into neat little boxes on a planning page. You’re creating a variety of perspectives from which to examine your life to ensure balance and harmony. The paradigm is always one of importance, interdependence, and relatedness.
