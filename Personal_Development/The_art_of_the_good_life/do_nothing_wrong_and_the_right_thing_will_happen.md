# Do Nothing Wrong and the Right Thing Will Happen {#do-nothing-wrong-and-the-right-thing-will-happen}

Focus on avoiding mistakes/negative things rather than doing everything right.

when we ask what factors have a significant _negative_ impact on the _good life_ we can pinpoint them exactly: alcoholism, drug addiction, chronic stress, noise, a lengthy commute, a job you despise, unemployment, a dysfunctional marriage, stupidly high expectations, poverty, debt and financial dependence, loneliness, spending too much time with moaning Minnies, overreliance on external validation, constant self-comparisons with others, thinking like a victim, self-loathing, chronic sleep deprivation, depression, anxiety, rage and envy.
