# The Pledge {#the-pledge}

When it comes to important issues, flexibility isn’t an advantage—it’s a trap.

Two reasons. First: constantly having to make new decisions situation by situation saps your willpower. _Decision fatigue_ is the technical term for this. A brain exhausted by decision-making will plump for the most convenient option, which more often than not is also the worst one.

The second reason inflexibility is so valuable has to do with reputation. By being consistent on certain topics, you signal where you stand and establish the areas where there’s no room for negotiation. You communicate self-mastery, making yourself less vulnerable to attack.
