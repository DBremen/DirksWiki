# Uplifting the mind {#uplifting-the-mind}

Here, we learn to uplift the mind with wholesome joy, especially joy arising from goodness, generosity, loving-kindness, and compassion. The wholesomeness of such joy benefits mental health the same way wholesome food benefits physical health.

**INFORMAL PRACTICE: ATTENDING TO THE JOY OF PLEASANT DAILY EXPERIENCES**

Whenever you engage in an activity that involves a pleasant experience, take at least one moment to attend fully to the joy that pleasantness invokes. Some examples:

At each meal, attend fully to the enjoyment of at least the first bite.

When seeing a loved one, especially a beloved child, take one moment to appreciate that he or she is there, and attend fully to that joy.

When holding hands with a loved one, take one moment to attend fully to the joy of that contact.

When taking a shower, attend fully to at least one moment of the enjoyment of the body’s contact with water.

When relieving yourself in the toilet, attend fully to at least one moment of the pleasure of relief.

When out on a nice day, take one moment to attend fully to the enjoyment of the weather.

When walking, take one moment to attend fully to the joy of being able to walk.

In general, when seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, or touching something pleasant, bring full attention to the joy for at least one moment, and when interacting with a beloved person, bring full attention to the joy of being with that person for at least one moment.

**INFORMAL PRACTICE: AWARENESS OF MORTALITY**

At least once a day, either in the morning shortly after waking up or in the evening shortly before sleep, or anytime in the day, remind yourself of these two things:

•Someday, I will die. I will die. Every moment I have is precious.

•Someday, every single person I love dearly will die. They will all die. Every moment I have with them is precious.

**INFORMAL PRACTICE: NOTICING THE ABSENCE OF PAIN**

Periodically, perhaps once a day, perhaps more frequently, bring awareness to the body to see if there is any experience of pain. Do you have a headache, a toothache, neck pain, back pain, or a stomachache? If any of those parts of the body is not in pain, you may remind yourself, “I do not have a headache / toothache / neck pain, etc., right now.” If any joy arises due to that thought, bring attention to that joy.

Periodically, perhaps once a day, perhaps more frequently, bring awareness to the mind to see if there is any experience of mental or emotional pain. Are you experiencing the pain of grief, sorrow, hatred, anger, jealousy, envy, want, grasping, fear, or desperation? If you are not experiencing any of those sources of pain right now, you may remind yourself, “I am not afflicted by the pain of grief / sorrow / hatred, etc., right now.” If any joy arises due to that thought, bring attention to that joy.

**FORMAL PRACTICE: JUST NOTE GONE**

Sit in any posture that allows you to be alert and relaxed at the same time, whatever that means to you. You may keep your eyes open or closed.

Sit in meditation for as many minutes as you like. Apply intense attention to the end of every out breath, clearly seeing the moment it ends. At the end of an out breath, if you like, you may silently note to yourself, “Gone.”

If any thought or sensation arises, see if you can watch it until it fades away. If it ceases at any time, even if for one moment, note its cessation. If you like, you may silently note to yourself, “Gone.”

You may end this meditation at any time. At the moment the meditation ends, take note of its ending. If you like, you may silently note to yourself, “Gone.”

**INFORMAL PRACTICE: WISHING FOR RANDOM PEOPLE TO BE HAPPY**

During working hours or school hours, randomly identify two people who walk past you or who are standing or sitting around you. Secretly wish for them to be happy. Just think to yourself, “I wish for this person to be happy, and I wish for that person to be happy.” That is the entire practice. Don’t do anything; don’t say anything; just think. This is entirely a thinking exercise.

If you prefer, you can do this at any time of the day for any amount of time. You can also do it at any other place. If there is nobody present, you can bring someone to mind for the purpose of this exercise.

If you like, you may pretend you are firing a “happiness ray gun” at them and make “pew, pew” sound effects in your head. Batteries not required.

**FORMAL PRACTICE: ATTENDING TO THE JOY OF LOVING-KINDNESS**

Sit in any posture that allows you to be alert and relaxed at the same time, whatever that means to you. You may keep your eyes open or closed.

Repeat this cycle once per minute: Bring to mind someone for whom you can very easily feel loving-kindness. Wish for him or her to be happy. The joy of loving-kindness may arise, and if that happens, bring full attention to the joy until it fades away. For the rest of the minute, just rest the mind.

When the next minute begins, start the cycle again, for a total of three minutes.
