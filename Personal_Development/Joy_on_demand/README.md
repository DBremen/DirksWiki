There are some really nice things in life that naturally reinforce each other, and in doing so, they form virtuous cycles with each other. For example, if you enjoy performing an activity that requires some level of skill, you may find yourself doing it a lot and getting better at it. And as you get better at it, you may derive even more enjoyment from it. And when you enjoy it more, you do it even more and get even better at it, and so on. So in this case, skillfulness and enjoyment form a virtuous cycle in which one strengthens the other—hence you end up benefiting from both at once, at no extra cost.

Joy and meditation are another pair of really nice things that form a virtuous cycle with each other. Meditation is training of the mind. Joy becomes highly accessible in a trained mind. With training, the mind learns to access inner joy with increasing ease and frequency. At the same time, the joyful mind is at peace, a peaceful mind is easily focused, and a focused mind becomes more trainable, thereby making meditation practice even more effective. Thus a virtuous and joyful cycle forms. Once you put it into motion, the meditation practice that perhaps you thought you’d never have can be sustained, and joy becomes a dominant factor in daily life.
