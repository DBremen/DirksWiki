<h1 id="exponential-backoff">Exponential backoff</h1>
<p>Originally used for TCP connections but can also be used in other
circumstances.</p>
<p>network to accommodate potentially any number of competing signals.
Since the maximum delay length (2, 4, 8, 16...) forms an exponential
progression, it's become known as Exponential Backoff.</p>
<h1 id="tcp-connections">TCP connections</h1>
<p>communication lapses are rarely so dire, and the need for certainty
rarely so absolute. In TCP, a failure generally leads to retransmission
rather than death, so it's considered enough for a session to begin with
what's called a "triple handshake." The visitor says hello, the server
acknowledges the hello and says hello back, the visitor acknowledges
that, and if the server receives this third message, then no further
confirmation is needed and they're off to the races. Even after this
initial connection is made, however, there's still a risk that some
later packets may be damaged or lost in transit, or arrive out of order.
In the postal mail, package delivery can be confirmed via return
receipts; online, packet delivery is confirmed by what are called
acknowledgment packets, or ACKs. These are critical to the functioning
of the network.</p>
<p>The way that ACKs work is both simple and clever. Behind the scenes of
the triple handshake, each machine provides the other with a kind of
serial number---and it's understood that every packet sent after that
will increment those serial numbers by one each time, like checks in a
checkbook. For instance, if your computer initiates contact with a web
server, it might send that server, say, the number 100. The ACK sent by
the server will in turn specify the serial number at which the server's
own packets will be</p>
<p>gin (call it 5,000), and also will say "Ready for 101." Your machine's
ACK will carry the number 101 and will convey in turn "Ready for 5,001."
(Note that these two numbering schemes are totally independent, and the
number that begins each sequence is typically chosen at random.)</p>
<p>This mechanism offers a ready way to pinpoint when packets have gone
astray. If the server is expecting 101 but instead gets 102, it will
send an ACK to packet 102 that still says "Ready for 101." If it next
gets packet 103, it will say, again, "Ready for 101." Three such
redundant ACKs in a row would signal to your machine that 101 isn't just
delayed but hopelessly gone, so it will resend that packet. At that
point, the server (which has kept packets 102 and 103) will send an ACK
saying "Ready for 104" to signal that the sequence has been restored.</p>
<h2 id="tcp-congestion-handling">TCP congestion handling</h2>
<p>At the heart of TCP congestion control is an algorithm called Additive
Increase, Multiplicative Decrease, or AIMD. Before AIMD kicks in, a new
connection will ramp up its transmission rate aggressively: if the first
packet is received successfully it sends out two more, if both of those
get through it sends out a batch of four, and so on. But as soon as any
packet's ACK does not come back to the sender, the AIMD algorithm takes
over. Under AIMD, any fully received batch of packets causes the number
of packets in flight not to double but merely to increase by 1, and
dropped packets cause the transmission rate to cut back by half (hence
the name Additive Increase, Multiplicative Decrease). Essentially, AIMD
takes the form of someone saying, "A little more, a little more, a
little more, whoa, too much, cut way back, okay a little more, a little
more..." Thus it leads to a characteristic bandwidth shape known as the
"TCP sawtooth"---steady upward climbs punctuated by steep drops.</p>
<h1 id="_1"></h1>
<h1 id="scheduling">Scheduling</h1>
<p>In fact, the weighted version of Shortest Processing Time is a pretty
good candidate for best general-purpose scheduling strategy in the face
of uncertainty. It offers a simple prescription for time management:
each time a new piece of work comes in, divide its importance by the
amount of time it will take to complete. If that figure is higher than
for the task you're currently doing, switch to the new one; otherwise
stick with the current task. This algorithm is the closest thing that
scheduling theory has to a skeleton key or Swiss Army knife, the optimal
strategy not just for one flavor of problem but for many.</p>
<p>Only that you need to consider the task switching time too. Too much
context switching might lead to less optimal execution following this
algorithm.</p>

<p>Of course, there's no reason that net worth---or, for that matter,
typing speed---needs to be the thing that you're measuring. Any
yardstick that provides full information on where an applicant stands
relative to the population at large will change the solution from the
Look-Then-Leap Rule to the Threshold Rule and will dramatically boost
your chances of finding the single best applicant in the group.</p>
<h1 id="mergesort">Mergesort</h1>
<p>Mergesort also has real applications in small-scale domestic sorting
problems. Part of the reason why it's so widely used is that it can
easily be parallelized. If you're still strategizing about that
bookshelf, the Mergesort solution would be to order a pizza and invite
over a few friends. Divide the books evenly, and have each person sort
their own stack. Then pair people up and have them merge their stacks.
Repeat this process until there are just two stacks left, and merge them
one last time onto the shelf. Just try to avoid getting pizza stains on
the books.</p>

<h1 id="probability-distributions">Probability distributions</h1>
<p><img alt="" src="../media_Mental_Models/media/image4.png" /></p>
<p>In a power-law distribution, the longer something has gone on, the
longer we expect it to continue going on. So a power-law event is more
surprising the longer we've been waiting for it---and maximally
surprising right before it happens. A nation, corporation, or
institution only grows more venerable with each passing year, so it's
always stunning when it collapses.</p>
<p>In a normal distribution, events are surprising when they're
early---since we expected them to reach the average---but not when
they're late. Indeed, by that point they seem overdue to happen, so the
longer we wait, the more we expect them.</p>
<p>And in an Erlang distribution, events by definition are never any more
or less surprising no matter when they occur. Any state of affairs is
always equally likely to end gardless of how long it's lasted. No wonder
politicians are always thinking about their next election.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../media_Mental_Models/media/image5.png" /></p>
<p>Gambling is characterized by a similar kind of steady-state expectancy.
If your wait for, say, a win at the roulette wheel were characterized by
a normal distribution, then the Average Rule would apply: after a run of
bad luck, it'd tell you that your number should be coming any second,
probably followed by more losing spins. (In that case, it'd make sense
to press on to the next win and then quit.) If, instead, the wait for a
win obeyed a power-law distribution, then the Multiplicative Rule would
tell you that winning spins follow quickly after one another, but the
longer a drought had gone on the longer it would probably continue. (In
that scenario, you'd be right to keep playing for a while after any win,
but give up after a losing streak.) Up against a memoryless
distribution, however, you're stuck. The Additive Rule tells you the
chance of a win now is the same as it was an hour ago, and the same as
it will be an hour from now. Nothing ever changes. You're not rewarded
for sticking it out and ending on a high note; neither is there a
tipping point when you should just cut your losses. In "The Gambler,"
Kenny Rogers famously advised that you've got to "Know when to walk away
/ Know when to run"---but for a memoryless distribution, there is no
right time to quit. This may in part explain these games' addictiveness.</p>
<h1 id="central-limit-theorem">Central limit theorem</h1>
<p>We called this section "The Bell Curve," however, because the normal
distribution is especially useful due to one of the handiest results in
all of statistics, called the central limit theorem. This theorem states
that when numbers are drawn from the same distribution and then are
averaged, this resulting average approximately follows a normal
distribution. This is the case even if the numbers originally came from
a completely different distribution.</p>

<h1 id="adverse-selection">Adverse selection</h1>
<p>When parties select transactions that they think will benefit them,
based at least partially on their own private information, that's called
adverse selection. People who know they are going to need dental work
are more likely to seek out dental insurance. This unfortunately drives
up the price for everyone. Two ways to mitigate adverse selection in the
insurance market are to mandate participation, as many localities do for
car insurance, and to distinguish subpopulations based on their risk
profiles, as life insurers do for smokers.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../media_Mental_Models/media/image10.png" /></p>
<h1 id="moral-hazard">Moral hazard</h1>
<p>This phenomenon, known as moral hazard, is where you take on more risk,
or hazard, once you have information that encourages you to believe you
are more protected. It has been a concern of the insurance industry
since the seventeenth century! Sometimes moral hazard may involve only
one person: wearing a bike helmet may give you a false sense of
security, leading you to bike more recklessly, but you are the one who
bears all the costs of a bike crash.</p>
<p>Moral hazards can also occur when a person or company serves as an agent
for another person or company, making decisions on behalf of this
entity, known as the principal. The problem arises when the agent takes
on more risk than the principal would if the principal were acting
alone, since the agent is more protected when things go wrong. For
instance, when financial advisers manage your money, they try to stick
to your risk profile, but they are more likely to take greater risks
than you would on your own, simply because it isn't their money, and so
losses do not impact their net worth as much.</p>
<h1 id="coase-theorem">Coase theorem</h1>
<p>There are many ways to internalize negative externalities, including
taxes, fines, regulation, and lawsuits. Smoking externalities are
internalized via cigarette taxes and higher health insurance premiums
for smokers. Traffic congestion externalities are internalized through
tolls. On a personal level, your neighbor might file a noise complaint
against you if you consistently play music too loud.</p>
<p>Another way to internalize externalities is through a marketplace.
Ronald Coase won the Nobel Prize in economics in 1991 in part for what
has become known as the Coase theorem, essentially a description of how
a natural marketplace can internalize a negative externality. Coase
showed that an externality can be internalized efficiently without
further need for intervention (that is, without a government or other
authority regulating the externality) if the following conditions are
met:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Well-defined property rights</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rational actors</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Low transaction costs</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When these conditions are met, entities surrounding the externality will
transact among themselves until the extra costs are internalized.</p>
<p><strong>Cap and trade systems</strong></p>
<p>The way these systems work is that the government requires emitters to
hold permits for the amount of pollutants they emit. The government also
sets a fixed number of total permits, which serves as the emission cap
in the market. Such a system satisfies the conditions of the Coase
theorem because property rights are well defined through the permitting
process, companies act rationally to maximize their profits, and the
open market provides low transaction costs.</p>

<h2 id="veil-of-ignorance">Veil of ignorance</h2>
<p>Two primary principles supplement Rawls' veil of ignorance: the liberty
principle and the difference principle.</p>
<p>According to the liberty principle, the social contract should try to
ensure that everyone enjoys the maximum liberty possible without
intruding upon the freedom of others.</p>
<p>According to the difference principle, the social contract should
guarantee that everyone has an equal opportunity to prosper. In other
words, if there are any social or economic differences in the social
contract, they should help those who are the worst off. And, any
advantages in the contract should be available to everyone.</p>
<p>So, according to Rawls, approaching tough issues through a veil of
ignorance and applying these principles can help us decide more fairly
how the rules of society should be structured. And fairness, as Rawls
and many others believe, is the essence of justice.</p>

<h1 id="bayes-theorem">Bayes Theorem</h1>
<p>Refine probability of an event occurring based on prior (base)
probability. You come home after a weekend and find someone else\'s

<h3 id="laplace">LaPlace</h3>
<p>How can we estimate the likelihood of winning in a raffle based on just
a few tickets.</p>
<p>After drawing a winning ticket on our first try we should expect that
the proportion of winning tickets in the whole pool is exactly 2/3. If
we buy three tickets and all of them are winners, the expected
proportion of winning tickets is exactly 4/5. In fact, for any possible
drawing of w winning tickets in n attempts, the expectation is simply
the number of wins plus one, divided by the number of attempts plus two:
(w+1)⁄(n+2).</p>
<p>This incredibly simple scheme for estimating probabilities is known as
Laplace's Law, and it is easy to apply in any situation where you need
to assess the chances of an event based on its history. If you make ten
attempts at something and five of them succeed, Laplace's Law estimates
your overall chances to be 6/12 or 50%, consistent with our intuitions.
If you try only once and it works out, Laplace's estimate of 2/3 is both
more reasonable than assuming you'll win every time, and more actionable
than Price's guidance (which would tell us that there is a 75%
metaprobability of a 50% or greater chance of success).</p>
<p>Count the number of times it has happened in the past plus one, then
divide by the number of opportunities plus two.</p>

<p><strong>Bias from mere association</strong> - We automatically feel pleasure or
    pain when we connect a stimulus - a thing, situation or individual-
    with an experience we\'ve had in the past or with values or
    preferences we are born with.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>John\'s supplier took him to the best steakhouse in town and picked up
the check. The next time it was time to buy new supplies, John
associated the supplier with pleasant feelings.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Merely because you associate some stimulus with earlier pain or
    &gt; pleasure doesn\'t mean the stimulus will cause the same pain or
    &gt; pleasure today. Past experiences are often context dependent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a negative emotion if you want to end a certain behavior. If
    you want someone to stop smoking, one way could be to show them what
    they stand to lose. Terrifying pictures may cause them to associate
    smoking with death. An action that is reinforced becomes stronger
    over time. This is how habits, superstitions and addictions are
    created.</p>

    and/or assuming events are equally likely when they are not.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlikely things happen if enough time passes. An event that has one
chance in 20 of happening in any given year (assume that the probability
stay the same over time) is nearly certain to happen over 50 years</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>20:1 = 4.8% p(happening) = 1-.48 p(happening)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1-(1-.048)^50^ = 91.5%</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Separate between independent and dependent events. The probability that
an airplane navigation system works is 99% and the probability that the
backup navigation system works is 90%. The probability that the backup
system fails is not influenced by whether the primary system fails or
not. The probability that neither navigation system works is one tenth
of a percent (0.01 * .1). Navigation system reliability is therefore
99.9% (at least one navigation system will work).</p>
<ul>
<li>Not adding a factor of safety for known and unknown risks. Size of
    factor depends on the consequences of failure, how well the risks
    are understood, systems characteristics and degree of control.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="coincidences-and-miracles">Coincidences and miracles</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Underestimating that surprises and improbable events happen,
    somewhere, sometime, to someone, if they have enough opportunities
    (large enough size or time) to happen.</p>
<p>Tossing tails 4 times in a row happens once for every
(1/[math]::Pow(.5,20))-1 = 1,048,575.00 people</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Looking for meaning, searching for causes and making up patterns for
    chance events, especially events that have emotional implications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Failing to consider cases involving the absence of a cause or
    effect.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="reliability-of-case-evidence">Reliability of case evidence</h3>
<ul>
<li>Overweighing individual case evidence and under-weighing the prior
    probability (probability estimate of an event before considering new
    evidence that might change it) considering for example, the base
    rate (relative frequency of an attribute or event in a
    representative comparison group), or evidence from many similar
    cases. Includes failing to consider the probability of a random
    match, and the probability of a false positive and false negative.
    Also failing to consider a relevant comparison population that bears
    the characteristic we are seeking.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>John testifies in court: \'1 witnessed the accident and the cab
involved was green. \"</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>John\'s probability being right = 80%</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cab\'s population = 90 blue and 10 green</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prior probability (before John is witnessing) = 10%</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" src="../media_Mental_Models/media/image47.png" /></p>
<p>Posterior % = (10*.8) / (90*.2) + (10*.8) = 8 / 26</p>
<p>Out of 100 cabs (90 blue and 10 green) John would identify 8 green
one\'s a green and 18 blue one\'s as green. The likelihood that the cab
was actually green when he is saying it was is 31% (8/26). It seems the
cab involved is more likely to have been blue.</p>
<h3 id="misrepresentative-evidence">Misrepresentative evidence</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Failing to consider changes in factors, context or conditions when
    using past evidence to predict likely future outcomes. Includes not
    searching for explanations to why past outcome happened, what is
    required to make past record continue, and what forces can change
    it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Overestimating evidence from a single case or small or
    unrepresentative samples.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Underestimating the influence of chance in performance (success and
    failure).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only seeing positive outcomes - paying little or no attention to
    negative outcomes and prior probabilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Failing to consider variability of outcomes and their frequency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Failing to consider regression - in any series of events where
    chance is involved unique outcomes tends to regress back to the
    average outcome.</p>
</li>
</ul>
