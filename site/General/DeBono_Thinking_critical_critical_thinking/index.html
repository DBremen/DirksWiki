<p>\"Say what you mean and mean what you say\" is a sound principle of
critical thinking (and of personal integrity, for that matter).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We must be idealistic (and thus capable of imagining a better
    world).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We must be realistic (and thus see things as they are).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We must be pragmatic (and thus adopt effective measures for moving
    toward our ideals).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="thinking-feeling-and-wanting">Thinking, feeling and wanting</h1>
<p><strong>It is important to recognize that the mind is composed of three
functions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Thinking</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Feeling</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Desiring (or wanting)</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Wherever one of these functions is present, the other two are present as
well. And these three functions are continually influencing and being
influenced by one another. Our thinking influences our feelings and
desires. Our feelings influence our thinking and desires. Our desires
influence our thinking and feeling. <strong>We cannot immediately change our
desires or feelings. It is only thinking that we have direct access
to.</strong> It makes no sense for someone to order you to feel what you do not
feel or to desire what you do not desire. We do not change feelings by
substituting other feelings, or desires by substituting other desires.
But someone can suggest that we consider a new way to think. We can
role-play new thoughts, but not new emotions or desires. It is possible
to reason within a point of view with which we do not agree. <strong>By
rethinking our thinking, we may change our thinking. When our thinking
changes, our feelings and desires will shift in accordance with our
thinking.</strong></p>
<h2 id="changing-negative-feelings-caused-by-irrational-thinking">Changing negative feelings caused by irrational thinking</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Identify a feeling you have experienced that you suspect might be
    irrational (a feeling such as irritability, resentment, arrogance,
    or depression).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What thinking would account for the feeling? There may be more than
    one possibility here. If so, figure out which possibility is most
    likely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Determine the extent to which the thinking is reasonable. Pay close
    attention to the reasons you give to justify the thinking. Is it
    possible that these are not your actual reasons? Can you think of
    any other motives you might have? Consider alternative
    interpretations of the situation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you conclude that the feeling is irrational, express precisely
    why you think so.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Construct thinking that would represent a rational response in the
    situation. Actively attack the irrational thinking with the thinking
    that is rational. Actively rehearse the thinking that represents a
    rational response.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="changing-irrational-behavior-grounded-in-irrational-desires-or-motivations">Changing irrational behavior grounded in irrational desires or motivations</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Identify the questionable behavior (behavior that is getting you in
    trouble, causing problems for you, or causing problems for someone
    else).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify the precise thinking leading to that behavior. What is the
    thinking that is generating the motivation to act in this manner?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Analyze the extent to which the thinking is justified, without
    leaving out any significant relevant information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the thinking is irrational, develop thinking that would be
    reasonable in this situation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Actively attack the unreasonable thinking with reasonable thinking.</p>

<p><strong>Critical thinking is, in short, self-directed, self-disciplined,

rigorous standards of excellence and mindful command of their use. It
entails effective communication and problem-solving abilities.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Critical thinking adds a second level of thinking to ordinary
thinking. The second level analyzes and assesses our ordinary
thinking.</strong></p>
<p><strong>First-Order-Thinking:</strong></p>
<p>It is spontaneous and non-reflective. It contains insight, prejudice,
truth and error, good and bad reasoning, all combined</p>

<p><strong>We can develop in such a way that we learn to see mistakes in our
    &gt; own thinking, as well as the thinking of others</strong></p>

<li>
<p><strong>Or we can merely develop some proficiency in making our
    &gt; opponent\'s thinking look bad.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Typically, people see mistakes in other\'s thinking without being
    &gt; able to credit the strengths in those opposing views.</strong></p>

<p>This kind of thinking fails to consider, in good faith, viewpoints

<p><strong>Work to understand and appreciate the viewpoints of others.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Be willing to listen to arguments you do not necessarily hold.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Change your views when faced with better reasoning.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Question your own purposes, evidence, conclusions, implications,

<p><strong>Fair-mindedness</strong> entails a consciousness of the need to treat all
viewpoints alike, without reference to one\'s own feelings or selfish
interests, or the feelings or selfish interests of one\'s friends,
company, community, or nation. It implies adherence to intellectual
standards (such as accuracy and sound logic), uninfluenced by one\'s
own advantage or the advantage of one\'s group.</p>
<p><strong>Intellectual humility</strong> (opposite of intellectual arrogance) may be
defined as having a consciousness of the limits of one\'s knowledge,
including a sensitivity to circumstances in which one\'s native
egocentrism is likely to function self-deceptively. This entails being
aware of one\'s biases, one\'s prejudices, the limitations of one\'s
viewpoint, and the extent of one\'s ignorance. Intellectual humility
depends on recognizing that one should not claim more than one
actually knows. It does not imply spinelessness or submissiveness. It
implies the lack of intellectual pretentiousness, boastfulness, or
conceit, combined with insight into the logical foundations, or lack
of such foundations, of one\'s beliefs.</p>
<p><strong>Intellectual courage</strong> may be defined as having a consciousness of
the need to face and fairly address ideas, beliefs, or viewpoints
toward which one has strong negative emotions and to which one has not
given a serious hearing. Intellectual courage is connected to the
recognition that ideas that society considers dangerous or absurd are
sometimes rationally justified (in whole or in part). Conclusions and
beliefs inculcated in people are sometimes false or misleading. To
determine for oneself what makes sense, one must not passively and
uncritically accept what one has learned. Intellectual courage comes
into play here because there is some truth in some ideas considered
dangerous and absurd, and distortion or falsity in some ideas strongly
held by social groups to which we belong. People need courage to be
fair-minded thinkers in these circumstances. The penalties for
nonconformity can be severe.</p>

<h2 id="behavior-of-critical-thinkers">Behavior of critical thinkers</h2>
<p>When they read, they see the text as a verbal representation of the
thinking of the author. They strive to enter the writer\'s point of
view. They strive to reconstruct the author\'s thinking in their own
mind. When they write, they think explicitly about the point of view of
their intended audience. They use their insight into the thinking of the
likely audience to present their thinking in the most accessible way.
Their speaking reflects a parallel emphasis. They use the dialogue to
find out specifically the point of view and concerns of those with whom
they are talking. They do not try to force their ideas on others. They
recognize that people must think their own way to ideas and beliefs.
They, therefore, share experiences and information more than final
conclusions. They listen attentively to the thinking of others. They ask
more questions than they make assertions.</p>
<p>Critical thinkers have a distinctive point of view concerning
themselves. They see themselves as competent learners. They have a \"can
do\" vision of their own learning. They do not see opposing points of
view as a threat to their own beliefs. They see <strong>all beliefs as subject
to change in the face of new evidence or better reasoning</strong>. They see
themselves as lifelong learners.</p>

<h2 id="3-distinct-memory-processes">3 distinct memory processes:</h2>
<h3 id="sensory-information-storage">Sensory information storage</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>SIS holds sensory images for several tenths of a second after they are
received by the sensory organs. The functioning of SIS may be observed
if you close your eyes, then open and close them again as rapidly as
possible. As your eyes close, notice how the visual image is
maintained for a fraction of a second before fading. It is not
possible to consciously extend the time that sensory information is
held in SIS. The function of SIS is to make it possible for the brain
to work on processing a sensory event for longer than the duration of
the event itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="short-term-memory">Short-term memory</h3>
<p>Information passes from SIS into short-term memory, where it is held for
only a few seconds or minutes. Whereas SIS holds the complete image, STM
stores only the interpretation of the image. If a sentence is spoken,
SIS retains the sounds, while STM holds the words formed by these
sounds.</p>
<p>Like SIS, short-term memory holds information temporarily, pending
further processing. This processing includes judgments concerning
meaning, relevance, and significance, as well as the mental actions
necessary to integrate selected portions of the information into
long-term memory.</p>
<p>When a person forgets immediately the name of someone to whom he or she
has just been introduced, it is because the name was not transferred
from short-term to long-term memory.</p>
<p>A central characteristic of STM is the severe limitation on its
capacity. A person who is asked to listen to and repeat a series of 10
or 20 names or numbers normally retains only five or six items. Commonly
it is the last five or six. If one focuses instead on the first items,
STM becomes saturated by this effort, and the person cannot concentrate
on and recall the last items. People make a choice where to focus their
attention.</p>
<p>They can concentrate on remembering or interpreting or taking notes on
information received moments ago, or pay attention to information
currently being received. Limitations on the capacity of short-term
memory often preclude doing both.</p>
<p>Retrieval of information from STM is direct and immediate because the
information has never left the conscious mind. Information can be
maintained in STM indefinitely by a process of "rehearsal"---repeating
it over and over again. But while rehearsing some items to retain them
in STM, people cannot simultaneously add new items. The severe
limitation on the amount of information retainable in STM at any one
time is physiological, and there is no way to overcome it.</p>
<h3 id="long-term-memory">Long-term memory</h3>
<p>Some information retained in STM is processed into long-term memory.
This information on past experiences is filed away in the recesses of
the mind and must be retrieved before it can be used. In contrast to the
immediate recall of current experience from STM, retrieval of
information from LTM is indirect and sometimes laborious.</p>
<p>Loss of detail as sensory stimuli are interpreted and passed from SIS
into STM and then into LTM is the basis for the phenomenon of selective
perception discussed in the previous chapter. It imposes limits on
subsequent stages of analysis, inasmuch as the lost data can never be
retrieved. <strong>People can never take their mind back to what was actually
there in sensory information storage or short-term memory. They can only
retrieve their interpretation of what they thought was there as stored
in LTM.</strong></p>
<h2 id="organization-of-information-in-memory">Organization of Information in memory</h2>
<p>The three memory processes comprise the storehouse of information or
database that we call memory, but the total memory system must include
other features as well. Some mental process must determine what
information is passed from SIS into STM and from STM into LTM; decide
how to search the LTM data base and judge whether further memory search
is likely to be productive; assess the relevance of retrieved
information; and evaluate potentially contradictory data. To explain the
operation of the total memory system, psychologists posit the existence
of an <strong>interpretive mechanism that operates on the data base and a
monitor or central control mechanism that guides and oversees the
operation of the whole system.</strong> Little is known of these mechanisms and
how they relate to other mental processes.</p>
<p>Physically, the brain consists of roughly 10 billion neurons, each
analogous to a computer chip capable of storing information. Each neuron
has octopus-like arms called axons and dendrites. Electrical impulses
flow through these arms and are ferried by neurotransmitting chemicals
across what is called the synaptic gap between neurons. <strong>Memories are
stored as patterns of connections between neurons.</strong> <strong>When two neurons
are activated, the connections or "synapses" between them are
strengthened.</strong></p>
<p>As you read this chapter, the experience actually causes physical
changes in your brain. "In a matter of seconds, new circuits are formed
that can change forever the way you think about the world." Memory
records a lifetime of experience and thoughts. Such a massive data
retrieval mechanism, like a library or computer system, must have an
organizational structure; otherwise information that enters the system
could never be retrieved. Imagine the Library of Congress if there were
no indexing system.</p>
<p><strong>Imagine memory as a massive, multidimensional spider web. This image
captures what is, perhaps the most important property of information
stored in memory---its interconnectedness.</strong> One thought leads to
another. It is possible to start at any one point in memory and follow a
perhaps labyrinthine path to reach any other point. Information is
retrieved by tracing through the network of interconnections to the
place where it is stored. <strong>Retrievability is influenced by the number
of locations in which information is stored and the number and strength
of pathways from this information to other concepts that might be
activated by incoming information</strong>. The more frequently a path is
followed, the stronger that path becomes and the more readily available
the information located along that path. If one has not thought of a
subject for some time, it may be difficult to recall details. After
thinking our way back into the appropriate context and finding the
general location in our memory, the interconnections become more readily
available. We begin to remember names, places, and events that had
seemed to be forgotten.</p>
<p>Once people have started thinking about a problem one way, the same
mental circuits or pathways get activated and strengthened each time
they think about it. This facilitates the retrieval of information.
These same pathways, however, also become the mental ruts that make it
difficult to reorganize the information mentally so as to see it from a
different perspective.</p>
<p>One useful concept of memory organization is what some cognitive
psychologists call a "schema." <strong>A schema is any pattern of
relationships among data stored in memory. It is any set of nodes and
links between them in the spider web of memory that hang together so
strongly that they can be retrieved and used more or less as a single
unit.</strong></p>
<h2 id="getting-information-into-and-out-of-long-term-memory">Getting Information Into and Out of Long-Term Memory</h2>
<p><strong>The key factor in transferring information from short-term to
long-term memory is the development of associations between the new
information and schemata already available in memory</strong>. This, in turn,
depends upon two variables: the extent to which the information to be
learned relates to an already existing schema, and the level of
processing given to the new information. Depth (level) of processing
refers to the amount of effort and cognitive capacity employed to
process information, and the number and strength of associations that
are thereby forged between the data to be learned and knowledge already
in memory.</p>
<p>The following illustrative tasks are listed in order of the depth of
mental processing required:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Say how many letters there are in each word on the list</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Give a word that rhymes with each word</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make a mental image of each word, make up a story that incorporates
    each word.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Memory Rarely Changes Retroactively.</strong></p>
<p>Memories are seldom reassessed or reorganized retroactively in response
to new information. For example, information that is dismissed as
unimportant or irrelevant because it did not fit an analyst's
expectations does not become more memorable even if the analyst changes
his or her thinking to the point where the same information, received
today, would be recognized as very significant.</p>

<h2 id="the-brain-is-a-pattern-matching-machine">The brain is a pattern matching machine</h2>
<p>The mind works to make sense of confusion and uncertainty. It works to
recognize familiar patterns, once such a pattern is recognized the mind
switches into it and follows it along (further thinking is unnecessary).
It works somewhat similar to driving a car. As soon as you hit a
familiar road you can stop using the map/asking for directions . Our
thinking continuously searches for those familiar roads that make
thinking unnecessary.</p>
<p>Once a pattern has been formed the mind no longer has to analyze or sort
information. All that is required is enough information to trigger the
pattern. The mind then follows along the pattern automatically in the
same way as a driver follows a familiar road.</p>
<p>Unless there are competing patterns then anything remotely similar to
the established pattern will be treated as if it were that pattern.</p>
<h2 id="how-the-mind-works-as-an-information-processing-system">How the mind works as an information processing system</h2>
<p>Perception is the way we look at things. Processing is what we do with
that perception.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../media_DeBono_Thinking_critical_critical_thinking/media/image9.png" /></p>
<h3 id="the-mind-is-an-active-information-system">The mind is an active Information system</h3>
<p>The first arriving ball (information) alters the surface. The altered
surface then affects the way in which further balls (information) is
received. Incoming information organizes itself into patterns.</p>
<p><strong>The purpose of perception is to allow patterns to form and then to use
them. In perception the mind works as a self-organizing information
system (active) which allows incoming experience to organize itself into
patterns.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We need to be aware that we may often lock into the wrong pattern
though.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The mechanisms for pattern changing within our mind are mistake,
accident and humour.</strong></p>
<p><em>In a self-maximizing system with a memory the arrangement of
information must always be less than the best possible arrangement.</em> A
pattern may persist because it is useful and adequate and yet a
restructuring of the pattern could give rise to something very much
better.</p>
<p>Sequence in which the information arrives determines the pattern:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../media_DeBono_Thinking_critical_critical_thinking/media/image10.png" /></p>
<h2 id="lateral-thinking">Lateral thinking</h2>
<p><em>"The vertical thinker says: 'I know what lam looking for.' The lateral
thinker says: 'I am looking but I won't know what I am looking for until
I have found it.'"</em></p>
<p>Lateral thinking is both an attitude of mind and also a number of
defined methods. The attitude of mind involves the willingness to try to
look at things in different ways. It involves an appreciation that any
way of looking at things is only one amongst many possible ways. It
involves an understanding of how the mind uses patterns and the need to
escape from an established pattern to switch into a better one.</p>
<p><em>Vertical thinking is analytical, lateral thinking is provocative</em></p>
<p>Lateral thinking has to do with change, especially when change involves
escaping from a pattern that has been satisfactory in the past. The
usual method of change is through criticism and attack. The weakness of
that method is that we can only consider change when a concept can be
shown to be inadequate and when the attacking party has the power to
carry through the change.</p>
<p>It may be necessary to be on the top of a mountain in order to find the
best way up. <em>With vertical thinking one has to be correct at every
step, with lateral thinking one does not have to be</em></p>
<p><strong>Hindsight and insight</strong>: We switch to a new pattern and suddenly see
that something is reasonable and obvious. In hindsight any creative idea
must be logical -- otherwise we could never accept it as having a value.
The mistake we make is to assume that since it is logical in hindsight
then the better exercise of logic could have got us there in the first
place. Lateral thinking seeks to achieve the pattern-switching that
occurs in insight.</p>
<h3 id="creative-hit-list">Creative hit list</h3>
<p>This is a formal target list of focuses that need creative thinking. The
list would be available on bulletin boards or a website.</p>
<p>The Creative Hit List provides a target and a demand. You are expected
to have ideas about the items on the list. You may even be specifically
asked to have an idea on a particular item by a particular date. A team
may be assigned a task from the list and asked to report back on a given
date.</p>
<p>The list may be changed but some items may be more permanent. There
should be about 10 items on the list. The List provides a permanent
background demand that emphasizes that creativity is always needed.</p>
<h3 id="concepts">Concepts</h3>
<p>You can identify the concept that seems to be in use and then seek to
find other ways of delivering the same concept.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There can be operational or functional concepts. These describe
    the way something is done.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There can be value concepts. Why this is of value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There can be purpose concepts. Why we are doing this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There can be descriptive concepts covering a whole range of things
    that seem to have something in common.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Concept extraction:</p>
<p>We seek to develop alternatives and new ideas by \'extracting the
concept\' and then looking around for other ways to deliver this concept
by means of a specific idea.</p>
<p>Take a piece of paper and a pen. You start with the defined purpose of
what you are trying to achieve at the right-hand side of the page. <strong>For
example, you might set out \'traffic congestion in cities\'.</strong> The
implied purpose is how to deal with the problem of traffic congestion in
cities. In your diagram, everything will need to flow or cascade from
this point on the paper.</p>
<p>The next level lays out the broad concepts, or \'thinking directions\',
which might help tackle the problem. These might be:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>reduce traffic</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improve traffic flow</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increase travel space.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We then move backwards (towards the right-hand side of the page) to list
the more specific concepts that could operate the broad concepts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1.1 For \'reducing traffic\' we might have: restrict the number of
vehicles; discourage traffic; reduce the need to travel; multi-user
vehicles.</p>
<p>2.1 For \'improving traffic flow\' we might have: deal with peak
travel </p>
</blockquote>
<p>We then take each of the specific concepts and see how this could be put
into action with specific ideas.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1.1.1 For \'restricting the number of vehicles\' we might have: high
entry tolls; vehicle purchase permission auction (as in Singapore);
special city access licenses.</p>
<p>1.1.2 For \'discouraging traffic\' we might have: high congestion
charges for entering the city (as in London); no provision for
parking; poor-quality</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="stepping-stone">Stepping stone</h3>
<p>Movement is for moving across channels. We use judgment for staying
within existing channels but are also able to use movement when we want
to change patterns.</p>
<p>In the judgment idiom, when we come to an idea which is wrong we dismiss
it and back away. In the movement idiom we use the idea as a stepping
stone to help us move to a different pattern. It means using the idea to
see where it leads to. It is not that we treat a bad idea as a good
idea.</p>
<p>When one Jumps right to the solution then the soundness of that solution
obviously cannot depend on the soundness of the path by which it was
reached. Nevertheless the solution may still make sense in its own right
without having to depend on the pathway by which it was reached. </p>
<h3 id="po-provocation-operation">Po provocation operation</h3>
<p>Self-organizing systems tend to settle down in a stable equilibrium,
which is called a local equilibrium. They remain in that state until
provocation moves them towards a more global equilibrium. What is
important is that the provocation is meant to be a provocation. It is
never meant to be an idea in itself. It is never meant to be just a
desire for improvement.</p>
<p>"There may not be a reason for saying something until after it has been
said"</p>
<p>Movement is obtained in a variety of ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Extracting the principle of an idea</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Following the moment-to-moment consequences</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Focusing on the difference from the usual</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spelling out the positive aspects</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can extract a concept and then work with this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can focus on the difference between the provocation and the
    usual situation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can pick out the positive aspects and work with these.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can imagine the provocation put into action and see what
    happens.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="escape">Escape</h5>
<p>Focus on things we take for granted and wonder whether they are indeed
the only or best way of doing things. E.g. A restaurant without chairs</p>
<p>It is difficult to identify those things we take for granted. To obtain
those we can try:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Dropping a feature</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Altering a feature</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finding an alternative way of achieving the same end</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="reversal">Reversal</h5>
<p>Here we take a normal relationship and reverse it. Filters are there to
remove some of the tar in cigarettes. \'Po, we add something instead of
removing it.\'</p>
<h5 id="distortion">Distortion</h5>
<p>Here there is a change in a sequence or a change in relationships.
Normally, you pick up the phone, dial the number and speak. \'Po, you
speak before you dial.\' This can lead to two ideas. The first is
voice-activated dialing -- which exists. The second idea is to build a
simple tape recorder into the phone.</p>
<h5 id="exaggeration">Exaggeration</h5>
<p>This is an exaggeration, upwards or downwards of any dimension. Po,
telephone calls can only last two minutes.\' This suggests a compression
technique so that you can talk at a normal speed, but the transmitted
message is compressed so as to occupy less of the line time. The
exaggeration must be unreasonable otherwise it has little provocative
effect.</p>
<h5 id="wishful-thinking">Wishful thinking</h5>
<p>The provocation is in the form of \'wouldn\'t it be nice if . . .\'. The
provocation must be more than just a desire. It would not be very
provocative to say \'Po, the trains were always on time\'. But it would
be provocative to say \'Po, you got paid for waiting for a train\'.</p>
<h3 id="random-stimulation-method">Random stimulation method:</h3>
<p>A random input (word, picture. We may also extract a function from the
word (e.g. elephant very large) serves to tap into lines of thought that
might otherwise have been hidden. In our thinking we move out of a
certain area along the traditional route. If we toss in a random word it
has its own associations. Sooner or later these link up with the
associations of the problem we are trying to solve.</p>
<h3 id="information-and-thinking">Information and thinking</h3>
<p>It is only our lack of complete information that makes it necessary for
us to think. The more information we have the better will our thinking
be and the more appropriate our actions. There are several areas where
we can never have complete information one of those is the future.</p>
<p>Information is no substitute for thinking and vice versa.</p>

<p>Survey of info that is already available and that which is still
required.</p>
<p><strong>Information In:</strong> The info already available is examined carefully.
All the implications and logical inferences are extracted from it.</p>
<p><strong>Information Out:</strong> The gaps in the information are examined, defined
and spelled out.</p>
<h3 id="thinking-methodology">Thinking methodology</h3>
<h4 id="clash-system">Clash system</h4>
<p>Western civilization has developed the clash system in which two
opposing views fight it out. This covers argument, debate. The method is
used in politics, courts, business decisions and other day to day living
areas.</p>
<p>Disadvantages of the clash system:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>As one side attacks and the other defends each point of view grows
    more rigid</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One or the other point will eventually prevail</p>
<ul>
<li>The other group is bitter and unwilling to make the new system
    work</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to change something an existing idea must be attacked and
    shown to be inadequate</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="eclectics">Eclectics</h4>
<p>Seeks to pull out of the situation what is of value -- no matter on
which side it is to be found. There are no opposing ideas to begin with.
There is joint listening and joint exploration. It is only later that
ideas start to emerge. We accept possibilities lay them out in parallel
and then seek to design forwards.</p>
<h5 id="ebs-examine-both-sides">EBS Examine both sides</h5>
<p>What is really the other point of view? The exploration is neutral.
Participants are encouraged to explore both sides in such a way that
from listening to their points you would be unable to tell which point
view they actually favor.</p>
<p>Doing an EBS does not exclude the holding of a point of view, but this
comes after the exploration not before it.</p>
<h5 id="adi-agreement-disagreement-irrelevance">ADI Agreement, Disagreement Irrelevance</h5>
<p>The two sides are compared (from EBS) and the areas of agreement are
noted. Next the areas of disagreement are noted and finally the areas of
irrelevance. In a difficult situation it might be better if for each
party strongly holding an opinion to do an ADI on its own.</p>
<p>It often turns out that this neutral exploration shows that the areas of
disagreement might be quite small compared to how large they appear in
the argument situation. Isolation the area of disagreement means that it
can be further examined in order to find out how basic the disagreement
might be.</p>
<h5 id="logic-bubble">Logic bubble</h5>
<p>A logic bubble is that bubble of perception within which a person is
acting. The bubble includes perception of circumstances, structure,
context and relationship. In any situation it is useful to map out the
logic bubbles of the other people involved.</p>
<h5 id="opv-other-peoples-view">OPV other people`s view</h5>
<p>In using the tool the thinker tries to put himself in the other
person`s shoes in order to look at the world from that position. This
involves the identification of the other people involved in a situation.</p>
<p>Doing an OPV does not mean putting into the mouths of all parties sane
and rational arguments of the sort one might hold oneself. Nor does it
mean putting into their mouths complaints and irrationality in order to
condemn their point of view. It means trying to look objectively at the
world from the other points of view.</p>
<h5 id="thinking-andvs-emotionsgut-feeling">Thinking and/vs. emotions/gut feeling</h5>
<p>Three possible ways in which thinking/perception can interact with
emotions.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Blind emotion: Emotion is present from the beginning even before the
    particular situation is encountered. This may happen with jealousy,
    hatred or aggression.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With our perception we examine the situation briefly. We recognize
    some pattern and that switches on our emotion. From then on our
    further perception is narrowed and channeled by that emotion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Broad and calm exploration of the situation and in the end emotions
    come in to make the final decision and choose the course of action.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Values are the links between events and our emotions they convert events
into matters about which we feel strongly.</p>
<h3 id="hv-and-lv-high-values-and-low-values">HV and LV High values and low values</h3>
<p>Divide the values occurring in a situation into high and low values.
High values are the one that determine action and the low values are the
ones which have to be taken into account. The examination of values is
an awareness exercise. It is a matter of becoming aware of the values
that are inherent in a situation the conflict of values as they are
perceived by the people involved and the source of these values. Pull
out the value laden words from a written or verbal conversation.</p>
<h3 id="six-thinking-hats">Six thinking hats</h3>
<p><strong>Parallel thinking</strong></p>
<p>Imagine a rather ornate building of a square shape. There are four
people, each of whom is facing one aspect of this building. Through a
mobile phone or walkie-talkie, each person is insisting and arguing that
he or she is facing the most beautiful aspect of the building.</p>
<p>Parallel thinking means that they change how they go about this
argument. All four people move around to the south side of the building
together. Then all of them move on to the west side. Then the north and
finally the east side. So all of them, in parallel, are looking at the
same side of the building at any one moment.</p>
<p>Instead of argument, where A is attacking B, we have a system where A
and B are both looking and thinking in the same direction -- but the
directions change as they move around. That is parallel thinking.</p>
<p>Method:</p>
<p>There is no fixed order of use. You can choose the sequence you want. In
training, some of the more useful sequences will be suggested.</p>
<h4 id="blue-hat">Blue Hat</h4>
<p>This is the organizing or control hat. It is rather like the conductor
of an orchestra. It is used right at the beginning of a discussion to
decide the focus and what sequence of hats to use. During the meeting
the chairperson or facilitator metaphorically wears the Blue Hat in a
disciplinary way. People are reminded of the hat in use if they stray
from that mode. The Blue Hat is used at the end for the outcome, summary
and next steps.</p>
<h4 id="white-hat">White Hat</h4>
<p>Think of white and paper and printout. The White Hat is concerned with
information. What information do we have? What information is missing?
What information do we need -- and how are we going to get it? Questions
can be asked under the White Hat. If conflicting information is put
forward, there is no argument. Both versions are put down in parallel
and then discussed when that information needs to be used.</p>
<h4 id="red-hat">Red Hat</h4>
<p>Think of red and fire and warmth. The Red Hat is to do with feelings,
emotions, intuition. Under the Red Hat all participants are invited to
put forward their feelings. In a normal discussion you can only put
forward these things if they are disguised as logic. Here there is no
need to justify or explain them. They exist and can therefore be put
forward. The Red Hat period is very brief and simply allows these things
to be put forward.</p>
<h4 id="black-hat">Black Hat</h4>
<p>Think of the black of a judge\'s robes. The Black Hat is for critical
thinking. What is wrong with the idea? What are its weaknesses? The
Black Hat looks at the down side, why something will not work, the risks
and dangers. All the negative comments that might be made during a
meeting are concentrated under the Black Hat. The Black Hat is very
useful, possibly the most useful of all the hats, but it has its defined
place.</p>
<h4 id="yellow-hat">Yellow Hat</h4>
<p>Think of sunshine and optimism, dawn and a new day. This focuses on the
positive. What are the benefits? The values? How could it be done?
Education is mostly about critical thinking. We never really develop
\'value sensitivity\'. This means the ability to find value in anything
-- even things we do not like and will not use. Nevertheless we should,
honestly and objectively, find value in such things. Without value
sensitivity, creativity can be a waste of time. I have sat in on
meetings where good ideas have been generated but no one has been able
to see the value of the ideas.</p>
<h4 id="green-hat">Green Hat</h4>
<p>Think of vegetation, growth and branches. This is directly concerned
with creativity. When the Green Hat is in use, participants are expected
to make a creative effort or keep quiet. They do not like keeping quiet
so they make that effort. This means looking for new ideas. It means
considering alternatives, both the obvious ones and new ones. It means
generating possibilities. It means modifying and changing a suggested
idea, possibly through the deliberate use of lateral thinking tools.</p>
<h1 id="de-bono-the-six-value-medals">De Bono: The Six Value Medals</h1>
<p>In a way, a perception is an unconscious about how we see the world
around us. Because they are unconscious we have no control over our
perceptions unless we make the driving values visible.</p>
<p>Logic can help you to decide how to do something but logic cannot tell
you what you want to do. The difficulty is that any decision made on a
value basis can always be "rationalized" in hindsight as being made on a
purely logical basis. We can seek to rationalize a bad decision made
purely on an emotional basis. If we are good at rationalizing we may not
realize just how bad the decision really is. If we come to believe that
our decisions are entirely logical, the greater danger is that we then
neglect to pay attention to our values and may not even realize how they
affect our decisions.</p>
<p>Values are the underlying drivers that bring about our emotions.</p>
