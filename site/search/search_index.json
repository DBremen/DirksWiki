An equilibrium model typically identifies a system that is at rest; this is called static equilibrium. When competing forces are equally matched, a system reaches dynamic equilibrium. A scale that is equally weighted on both sides is an example of static equilibrium. Fill a bathtub full of water and then turn off the faucet and you will observe static equilibrium. But if you unplug the drain and then turn on the faucet so the level of the bathtub does not change, you are witnessing dynamic equilibrium. Another example is the human body. It remains in dynamic equilibrium so long as the heat loss from cooling remains in balance with the consumption of sugars.</p> <p>Economic equilibrium: The simplest case of balance or equilibrium between desire and effort is found when a person satisfies one of his wants by his own direct work. When a boy picks blue-berries for his own eating, the action of picking is probably itself pleasurable for a while; and for sometime longer the pleasure of eating is more than enough to repay the trouble of picking. But after he has eaten a good deal, the desire for eating diminishes; while the task of picking begins to cause weakness, which may indeed be a feeling of monotony rather than fatigue.</p> <p>Equilibrium is reached when at last his eagerness to play and his disinclination for the work of picking counterbalance the desire for eating.^3^</p> <p>Efficient market theory: Fama's message was clear. Stock prices are unpredictable because the market is too efficient. In an efficient market, a great many smart people (Fama called them \"rational profit maximizers\") have simultaneous access to all the relevant information, and they aggressively apply that information in a way that causes prices to adjust instantaneously---thus restoring equilibrium---before anyone can profit. Predictions about the future therefore have no place in an efficient market, because share prices fully reflect all available information.</p> <p>Sharpe: Sharpe was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics for developing \"a market equilibrium theory of asset prices under conditions of risk.\" His theory was originally outlined in a 1964 paper entitled \"Capital Asset Prices: A Theory of Market Equilibrium under Conditions of Risk.\" Sharpe explained, \"In equilibrium, there is a simple linear relationship between the expected return and standard deviation of return (defined as risk).\"^11^ According to Sharpe, the only way to achieve a greater return is to incur additional risk. To increase expected returns, investors need only march further out the capital market line. Conversely, if investors wished to assume less risk, they would step down the capital line and by doing so receive less return. In either case, equilibrium is maintained.</p> <p>The counterview from Santa Fe suggests the opposite: a market that is not rational, is organic rather than mechanistic, and is imperfectly efficient. It assumes the individual agents are, in fact, irrational and hence will misprice securities, creating the possibility for profitable strategies.</p>"},{"location":"Finance/Investement_models/#biology","title":"Biology","text":""},{"location":"Finance/Investement_models/#evolution","title":"Evolution","text":"<p>Whereas in nature the process of evolution is one of natural selection, seeing the market within an evolutionary framework allows us to observe the law of economic selection.</p>"},{"location":"Finance/Investement_models/#complex-adaptive-systems","title":"Complex adaptive systems","text":"<p>El Farol, a bar in Santa Fe, New Mexico, used to feature Irish music on Thursday nights. Arthur, the Irishman, loved to go there. On most occasions, the bar patrons were well behaved, and it was enjoyable to sit and listen to the music. But on some nights, the bar was packed with so many people crammed together drinking and singing that the scene became unruly. Now Arthur was confronted with a problem: How could he decide which nights to go to El Farol and which nights to stay home? The chore of having to decide led him to formulate a mathematical theory he named the El Farol Problem. It has, he says, all the characteristics of a complex adaptive system.</p> <p>Suppose, says Arthur, there are one hundred people in Santa Fe who are interested in going to El Farol to listen to Irish music, but none of them wants to go if the bar is going to be crowded. Now also suppose the bar published its weekly attendance for the past ten weeks. With this information, the music lovers will build models to predict how many people will show up next Thursday. Some may figure that it will be approximately the same number of people as last week. Others will take an average of the last few weeks. A few will attempt to correlate attendance data to the weather or to other activities for the same audience. There will be endless ways to build models to predict how many people will go to the bar.</p> <p>Now let's say that every lover of Irish music decides that the comfort level in the small bar is sixty people. All one hundred people will decide, using whatever predictor has been the most accurate over the last few weeks, when the limit is going to be reached. Because each person has a different predictor, on any given Thursday some people will turn up at El Farol and others will stay home because their model has predicted more than sixty people will be attending. The following day, El Farol publishes its attendance and the hundred music lovers will update their models and get ready for next week's prediction.</p> <p>The El Farol process can be termed an ecology of predictors, says Arthur. At any point, there is a group of models that are deemed \"alive\"---that is, they are useful predictors of how many people will attend the bar. Conversely, predictors that turn out to be inaccurate will slowly die off. Each week, new predictors, new models, new beliefs will compete for use by other music lovers.</p> <p>We can quickly see how the El Farol process echoes the Darwinian idea of survival through natural selection and how logically it extends to economies and markets. In the markets, each agent's predictive models compete for survival against the models of all other agents, and the feedback that is generated causes some models to be changed</p> Biological Financial Species Trading Strategy Individual organism Trader Genotype (genetic const.)

As the memories of the 1929 market crash faded and prosperity returned, investors were increasingly attracted to stocks that paid high dividends, and lower-paying bonds lost favor. So popular was the dividend strategy that by the 1950s, the yield on dividend-paying stocks dropped below the yield of bonds---a historical first.</p> <p>3.\u00a0\u00a0By the 1960s, a third strategy appeared. Investors exchanged stocks paying high dividends for companies that were expected to grow their earnings at a high rate.</p> <p>4.\u00a0\u00a0By the 1980s, a fourth strategy took over.

At first, this discovery appears counterintuitive. Today, we are quick to blame the amateur behavior of uninformed individual investors and day traders for the volatile nature of the market. But if Johnson is correct, the diverse participation of all investors, traders and speculators---smart and dumb alike---should make the markets stronger, not weaker.</p> <p>The two critical variables necessary for a collective to make superior decisions are diversity and independence. If a collective is able to tabulate decisions from a diverse group of individuals who have different ideas or opinions on how to solve a problem, the results will be superior to a decision made by a group of like-minded thinkers.</p> <p>We know the stock market is an incentive-based system that can aggregate investor decisions. What we need to understand is the market's level of diversity and the independence of its participants. If the stock market is adequately diversified and, most importantly, if the decisions of its participants have been reached independently, then it is likely the market is efficient. Surowiecki reminds us that just because we can observe some irrational investors, that does not necessarily mean the market is inefficient. Indeed, proponents of the efficient market hypothesis have latched onto the \"wisdom of the crowds\" as a plausible explanation for market efficiency.</p> <p>But what if independence is lost? What if the decisions of the market's participants are not independent but are now coalesced into one opinion? When this occurs, the system has effectively lost its diversity and along with it any chance of generating an optimal solution. If diversity is the key to how collectives can best reach solutions, then diversity breakdowns are the cause of suboptimal outcomes---or in the case of the stock market, diversity breakdowns cause the market to become inefficient.</p> <p>\"information cascades (which can lead to diversity breakdowns) occur when people make decisions based on the actions of others rather than on their own private information.

Buying and selling continue with no discernible change in the overall behavior of the market. We might say the sand pile is growing without any corresponding avalanche effects. Put differently, diversification is present in the market.</p> <p>But when stock prices climb, the ratio of trend followers to fundamentalists begins to grow. This makes sense. As prices increase, a larger number of fundamentalists decide to sell and leave the market and are replaced by a growing number of trend followers who are attracted to rising prices. When the relative number of fundamentalists is small, stock market bubbles occur, explained Bak, because prices have moved far above the fair price a fundamentalist would pay. Extending the sand pile metaphor further, as the number of fundamentalists in the market declines, and the relative number of trend followers increases, the slope of the sand pile becomes ever steeper, increasing the possibility of an avalanche. Once again, we can put this differently by saying that when the mix of fundamentalists and trend followers becomes unbalanced, we are heading toward a diversity breakdown.</p> <p>It is important for us to remember at this point that while Per Bak's self-organizing criticality explains the overall behavior of avalanches, it does nothing to explain any one particular avalanche.</p> <p>An obvious question at this point is how people select from a collection of choices. According to Richards, if there is no clear favorite, the tendency of the system is to continually cycle over the possibilities. You might think this cyclical outcome would lead to instability, but according to Richards, it need not if the agents share similar mental concepts (that is, mutual knowledge) about the various choices. It is when the agents in the system do not have similar concepts about the possible choices that the system is in danger of becoming unstable. And that is clearly the case in the stock market.</p> <p>At this point, we have a fixed compass on how to analyze social systems. Whether they are economic, political, or social, we can say these systems are complex (they have a large number of individual units), and they are adaptive (the individual units adapt their behavior on the basis of interactions with other units as well as with the overall system). We also recognize that these systems have self-organizing properties and that, once organized, they generate emergent behavior. Finally, we realize that complex adaptive systems are constantly unstable and periodically reach a state of self-organized criticality.</p>"},{"location":"Finance/Investement_models/#psychology","title":"Psychology","text":""},{"location":"Finance/Investement_models/#loss-aversion","title":"Loss aversion","text":"<p>Equity risk premium is a term many investors have heard but few actually understand. It refers to the potential for higher returns represented by the inherently risky stock market compared to the risk-free rate, defined as the rate of a ten-year U.S. Treasury bond in effect at whatever point you're considering. (It is called the risk-free rate because up until now the government has never defaulted on its loans.) Whatever return an individual stock or the overall stock market earns beyond that rate is the investor's compensation for taking on the higher risk of the stock market---the equity risk. For example, if the return on a stock is 10 percent and the risk-free rate is 5 percent over the same period, the equity risk premium would be 5 percent. The size of the risk premium will vary based on the perceived riskiness of a particular stock or the stock market as a whole. According to Aswath Damodaran, professor of finance at the Stern School of Business at New York University, the implied equity risk premium has vacillated between less than 3 percent in 1961 and 6.5 percent in the early 1980s.</p> <p>Thaler and Benartzi were puzzled by two questions. One, why is the equity risk premium so high; and two, why is anyone willing to hold bonds when we know that over the years, stocks have consistently outperformed? The answer, they believed, rested upon two central concepts from Kahneman and Tversky. The first was loss aversion. The second was a behavioral concept called mental accounting.</p> <p>T haler and Benartzi reasoned the longer the investor holds an asset, the more attractive the asset becomes but only if the investment is not evaluated frequently. If you don't check your portfolio every day, you will be spared the angst of watching daily price gyrations; the longer you hold off, the less you will be confronted with volatility and therefore the more attractive your choices seem. Put differently, the two factors that contribute to an investor's unwillingness to bear the risks of holding stocks are loss aversion and a frequent evaluation period.</p> <p>Using the medical word for shortsightedness, Thaler and Benartzi coined the term myopic loss aversion to reflect a combination of loss aversion and the frequency with which an investment is measured.</p> <p>Thaler and Benartzi next considered whether myopic loss aversion could help explain the equity risk premium. They wondered what combination of loss aversion and evaluation frequency would explain the historical pattern of stock returns. How often, they asked, would an investor need to evaluate a stock portfolio to be indifferent to the historical distribution of returns on stocks and bonds? The answer: one year.</p> <p>Thaler and Benartzi argue that any discussion of loss aversion must be accompanied by a specification of the frequency by which returns are calculated. Clearly, investors are less attracted to high-risk investments like stocks when they evaluate their portfolio over shorter time horizons. \"Loss aversion is a fact of life,\" explain Thaler and Benartzi. \"In contrast, the frequency of evaluations is a policy choice that presumably could be altered, at least in principle.\"</p>"},{"location":"Finance/Investement_models/#noise-and-signal","title":"Noise and signal","text":"<p>We are, through a long process of evolution, acutely uncomfortable and anxious in the face of uncertainty, so much so that we are willing to listen to those who promise to alleviate that anxiety.

This correcting device would take the information from the receiving terminal, separate out the noise, and then reconstruct the messages so the information arrived correctly at its final destination.</p> <p>Shannon's correction system is a perfect metaphor for how investors should process information. We must mentally place a correcting device in our information channel. The first task for this correcting device is to maintain integrity of the information coming from the source.

To reach a higher level of understanding, we must remain open-minded to accepting new descriptions of systems that appear complex, whether they are financial markets, social and political systems, or the physical world.</p> <p>For investors it is important to realize the slippery slope of narratives. Storytelling inadvertently increases our confidence in propositions as the story itself becomes its own proof. \"The focus of stories is on the individual rather than the averages, on motives rather than movements, on context rather than raw data,\" explains Paulos.^15^ Because investors primarily use storytelling to explain markets and economies, the absence of statistical evidence weakens the description.

Overvaluation and undervaluation can persist for a period longer---much longer---than patient rationality might dictate. Second, volatility is so high, with deviations so irregular, that stock prices don't correct neatly or come to rest easily on top of the mean.

So like a metre or a kilogram, a dollar itself doesn't refer to any physical thing at all---even if the length or mass or value of some particular physical thing has been agreed on as its standard.</p> <p>Economic value is a property of the social world; whereas linear extension, mass, temperature, and so on are properties of physical world. The choice of standard for the measurement of physical concepts is a question of technical efficiency. But the uses to which measurement of the social property of economic value are put are qualitatively quite different; It is, therefore, not just a technical, but also an ethical question; and the criterion for choosing it is not only which standard unit is efficient, but which is fair.</p> <p>The universal application of the new concept of economic value brings with it a major problem: the lack of any intrinsic limit to consumption, accumulation, and the quest for status.</p> <p>Money is not a commodity medium of exchange, but a social technology composed of three fundamental elements.</p> <ul> <li> <p>The first is an abstract unit of value in which money is     denominated.</p> </li> <li> <p>The second is a system of accounts, which keeps track of the     individuals' or the institutions' credit or debt balances as they     engage in trade with one another.

It is when that IOU can be passed on to a third     party---when it is able to be \"negotiated\" or \"endorsed,\" in the     financial jargon---that credit comes to life and starts to serve as     money.

In every case, these were examples of trade that was accounted for in pounds, shillings, and pence, just as it was in modern England. Sellers would accumulate credit on their books, and buyers debts, all denominated in monetary units. The fact that any net balances that remained between them might then be discharged by payment of some commodity or other to the value of the debt did not mean that that commodity was \"money.\" To focus on the commodity payment rather than the system of credit and clearing behind it was to get things completely the wrong way round.</p> <p>A moment's reflection shows that a staple commodity could not be used as money, because ex hypothesis the medium of exchange is equally receivable by all members of the community. Thus if the fishers paid for their supplies in cod, the traders would equally have to pay for their cod in cod, an obvious absurdity.</p> <p>If the fei of Yap (the big stones used at a German owned island in the pacific) were not a medium of exchange, then what were they? The fei were just tokens by which these accounts were kept. As in Newfoundland, the inhabitants of Yap would accumulate credits and debts in the course of their trading in fish, coconut, pigs, and sea cucumber. These would be offset against one another to settle payments. Any outstanding balances carried forward at the end of a single exchange, or a day, or a week, might, if the counterparties so wished, be settled by the exchange of currency---a fei---to the appropriate value; this being a tangible and visible record of the outstanding credit that the seller enjoyed with the rest of Yap.</p> <p>Coins and currency, in other words, are useful tokens to record the underlying system of credit accounts and to implement the underlying process of clearing. They may even be necessary in an economy larger than that of Yap, where coins could drop to the bottom of the sea and yet no one would think to question the wealth of their owner. But currency is not itself money. Money is the system of credit accounts and their clearing that currency represents or simply tokens to keep track of the underlying and ever-fluctuating balances of millions upon millions of credit and debt relationships</p> <p>Why, in short, is the conventional theory of money so resilient? There are two basic reasons, and they are worth dwelling on.The first reason has to do with the historical evidence for money. The second reason why the nature of money is so difficult to pin down, and why it has been and remains a subject of such controversy, is precisely because it is such an integral part of our economies. When we try to understand money, we are like the fish of the Chinese proverb, trying to know the very water in which it moves.</p>"},{"location":"Finance/Money/#bank-closure-ireland","title":"Bank closure Ireland","text":"<p>On 4 May 1970, a prominent notice appeared in Ireland's leading daily newspaper, the Irish Independent, with a simple but alarming title: \"CLOSURE OF BANKS.\" At the time, however, this development was widely expected---not least because it had happened once before, in 1966. The matter of dispute between the banks and their employees was a familiar one in the Europe of the late 1960s: the extent to which pay was keeping up with prices. High inflation throughout 1969---by the autumn, the cost of living had risen by more than 10 per cent over the previous fifteen months---had prompted a demand by the employees' union for a new pay settlement.

Each different shape and size of token represented a different type and quantity of a particular staple commodity: incised cones for bread, ovoids for oil, rhomboids for beer, and so on. Around 3100 bc, in Mesopotamian Uruk, a critical innovation was made. Records began to be kept not using collections of the tokens themselves, but by making impressions of the tokens on moist clay tablets. Soon after the invention of writing, however, another momentous improvement was made. Instead of writing five sheep symbols to signify five sheep, separate symbols for the number five and the category sheep were introduced. Now, only two symbols were required, instead of five.</p> <p>Correspondence-counting (making notches in tally sticks) requires no notion of abstract number; no concept, that is, of number separate from the things being counted. The new system did. Not only had Ur invented writing, it had almost simultaneously invented the concept of number---and thereby opened the way to the development of mathematics. The invention of writing and abstract number set the stage for the development of the third technology at the heart of Mesopotamian society: accounting.</p> <p>Money was a technology built on the basis of the revolutionary notion of economic value---an invisible substance that was both everywhere and nowhere, and which had a presence in the physical world only via the symbolism of coinage.

A local tradesman's promise to pay might not be worth much beyond his small circle of suppliers and clients. But the promise of one of the international merchant houses, with their much larger volume of trade, their great stocks of reserves, and their long histories of success, was a different matter. If a great merchant substituted his word for that of a local tradesman, an IOU that might previously have circulated at most within the local economy could be transformed into one that could circulate anywhere where the great merchant's prestige was acknowledged. A pyramid of credit could be constructed, with the obligations of local tradesmen as the base, larger wholesalers in the middle, and the most exclusive, well-known, and tight-knit circle of international merchants at the top.</p> <p>A bank is in essence an institution which writes IOUs on the one hand---these are its deposits, its bonds, its notes; generically, its liabilities---and accumulates IOUs on the other---its loans and its securities portfolio; generically, its assets.</p> <p>While in normal businesses the main assets are plants, premises, inventories almost all a bank's assets are nothing but promises to pay, and almost all its liabilities likewise.</p> <p>IOUs has two fundamental characteristics: its creditworthiness---how likely it is that it will be paid when it comes due---and its liquidity---how quickly it can be realised, either by sale to a third party or simply by coming due if no sale is sought. Accepting a promise to pay in a year's time entails more risk than accepting a promise to pay tomorrow: a lot more can go wrong in year than in twenty-four hours. This is the dimension of liquidity risk---Then there is the possibility that the IOU's issuer will not be able to pay at all, regardless of the time frame this is the dimension of credit risk.</p> <p>The whole business of banking resolves into the management of these two types of risk, as they apply both to a bank's assets and to its liabilities.</p> <p>Banks' liabilities remain short-term and of fixed nominal value, and their assets remain long-term and of uncertain nominal value</p> <p>When the higher complications of credit risk are absent, the essence of the banker's art comes into focus.

Of course, money is not the only system for organising society that can answer this question. The redistributive engine of the Western welfare state, in which social rights rather than economic value determine who gets what, is an obvious example of an alternative.

Initial attempts were made to dismiss the events as abnormal, with a variety of reasons to set aside the behavior as psychopathological but not typical of the species. It tends to be adult males doing the killing. The actions are not random; the infants are the offspring of other males. It\\'s a competitive strategy that reduces the other guy\\'s reproductive success while improving the killer\\'s since the female no longer has anything to mother and can now move back into the birthing cycle and have his offspring. There is a formula for this - competitive infanticide occurs when the time between births by the mother is shorter than the average reign for the top male. So the competitive infanticide is there to ensure that he doesn\\'t miss out on the chance to breed with the female when she\\'s busy rearing her offspring instead of mating with him.</p> <p>With chimpanzees females leave the group at the age of puberty in order to avoid inbred (incest) (make the gen pool more diverse). Therefore, the group usually consists of males that are related to each other. While this discourages fights between the males (kinship selection) it usually leads to intergroup warfare, where the group of chimps organizes itself and does warfare against another group of chimps.</p> <p>This relates to military techniques that aim to create a sense of kinship among the troops.

This is where genes come in. Genes specify (code for) proteins. Proteins are built from amino acids, of which there are approximately 20 that commonly occur. Each one has to be coded for with a different DNA sequence, a different DNA sequence of 3 letters (3 nucleotides). He notes that in the process DNA first specifies a code string of RNA which then specifies the protein construction (amino acid string). Thus if you know the DNA then you will know the RNA which in turn gives you a sense of the amino acids which will form the protein and knowing that informs you of the shape of the protein (different amino acids vary in their attraction toward water and these levels influence the ultimate shape) which clues you in on the function of the protein. That is the critical link from the DNA to the function and the notion of a behavior being genetically controlled.</p> <p>Francis Crick is credited with establishing a central dogma of genetics - DNA codes for RNA which codes for proteins. Sapolsky focuses the listener on a subtle element of this dogma, which is that DNA is ultimately in charge, sitting around and deciding what will happen and when, and then releasing the instructions that become the RNA to protein chain. Surprisingly, DNA isn\\'t always in charge. Viruses are mentioned as an example. Viruses are basically snippets of DNA that get into a living organism and hijack its DNA, taking over the plane and directing where it goes, making it function for the virus\\'s desire. In the 1970\\'s viruses made of RNA were discovered. The pathway is facilitated by enzymes which convert the RNA into DNA and start up the whole parasitic process. Accordingly, these are called retroviruses because they are reverting from RNA back to DNA.</p> <p>Next up is the whole sibling chimpanzee percentage topic. You share 50% of your genes with a sibling, but you share 98% of your genes with chimpanzee. What? This is about the level we look at. For example, chimps and humans have noses, so that\\'s a commonality when compared to a tree, which only has a nose when it\\'s in \\\"The Lord of the Rings\\\" or wandering around Stanford. However, humans can have button noses, aristocratic noses, etc. which is a DNA difference but at a much more specific level.</p> <p>The instruction booklet part of DNA is all about when and under what circumstances to activate and start and stop creating proteins. (For example, human growth hormone is released throughout life but has peak periods.) For better or worse this means that DNA doesn\\'t \\\"know\\\" what it\\'s doing. Instead it\\'s a read-out that\\'s under the control of lots of other factors. Among these are the regulatory sequences upstream from the gene. These might be called promoter or repressive sequences that promote or repress the expression of DNA snippets downstream. They are like switches. And they are turned on when the right event (internal or external) happens. These events are triggered by transcription factors. These might turn on single genes or whole networks in the DNA. On the flipside, any given gene can have a whole bunch of different promoters that it\\'s waiting to hear from before it does its thing.</p>"},{"location":"General/Biological_behaviour/#behavioural-genetics","title":"Behavioural Genetics","text":"<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRYcSuyLiJk</p>"},{"location":"General/Biological_behaviour/#why-do-we-do-what-we-do","title":"Why do we do what we do?","text":"<p>Understanding the context!</p> <p></p> <p></p>"},{"location":"General/Biological_behaviour/#based-on-different-parts-of-the-brain","title":"Based on different parts of the brain","text":""},{"location":"General/Biological_behaviour/#pre-frontal-cortex","title":"Pre-frontal cortex","text":"<p>Responsible for delayed gratification and impulse control</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p>"},{"location":"General/Biological_behaviour/#dopamine","title":"Dopamine","text":"<p>Reward system.

This processing includes judgments concerning meaning, relevance, and significance, as well as the mental actions necessary to integrate selected portions of the information into long-term memory.</p> <p>When a person forgets immediately the name of someone to whom he or she has just been introduced, it is because the name was not transferred from short-term to long-term memory.</p> <p>A central characteristic of STM is the severe limitation on its capacity. A person who is asked to listen to and repeat a series of 10 or 20 names or numbers normally retains only five or six items. Commonly it is the last five or six.

Limitations on the capacity of short-term memory often preclude doing both.</p> <p>Retrieval of information from STM is direct and immediate because the information has never left the conscious mind. Information can be maintained in STM indefinitely by a process of \"rehearsal\"---repeating it over and over again.

It imposes limits on subsequent stages of analysis, inasmuch as the lost data can never be retrieved.

Some mental process must determine what information is passed from SIS into STM and from STM into LTM; decide how to search the LTM data base and judge whether further memory search is likely to be productive; assess the relevance of retrieved information; and evaluate potentially contradictory data. To explain the operation of the total memory system, psychologists posit the existence of an interpretive mechanism that operates on the data base and a monitor or central control mechanism that guides and oversees the operation of the whole system. Little is known of these mechanisms and how they relate to other mental processes.</p> <p>Physically, the brain consists of roughly 10 billion neurons, each analogous to a computer chip capable of storing information. Each neuron has octopus-like arms called axons and dendrites. Electrical impulses flow through these arms and are ferried by neurotransmitting chemicals across what is called the synaptic gap between neurons. Memories are stored as patterns of connections between neurons. When two neurons are activated, the connections or \"synapses\" between them are strengthened.</p> <p>As you read this chapter, the experience actually causes physical changes in your brain. \"In a matter of seconds, new circuits are formed that can change forever the way you think about the world.\" Memory records a lifetime of experience and thoughts. Such a massive data retrieval mechanism, like a library or computer system, must have an organizational structure; otherwise information that enters the system could never be retrieved. Imagine the Library of Congress if there were no indexing system.</p> <p>Imagine memory as a massive, multidimensional spider web. This image captures what is, perhaps the most important property of information stored in memory---its interconnectedness. One thought leads to another. It is possible to start at any one point in memory and follow a perhaps labyrinthine path to reach any other point. Information is retrieved by tracing through the network of interconnections to the place where it is stored. Retrievability is influenced by the number of locations in which information is stored and the number and strength of pathways from this information to other concepts that might be activated by incoming information. The more frequently a path is followed, the stronger that path becomes and the more readily available the information located along that path. If one has not thought of a subject for some time, it may be difficult to recall details. After thinking our way back into the appropriate context and finding the general location in our memory, the interconnections become more readily available. We begin to remember names, places, and events that had seemed to be forgotten.</p> <p>Once people have started thinking about a problem one way, the same mental circuits or pathways get activated and strengthened each time they think about it. This facilitates the retrieval of information. These same pathways, however, also become the mental ruts that make it difficult to reorganize the information mentally so as to see it from a different perspective.</p> <p>One useful concept of memory organization is what some cognitive psychologists call a \"schema.\" A schema is any pattern of relationships among data stored in memory. It is any set of nodes and links between them in the spider web of memory that hang together so strongly that they can be retrieved and used more or less as a single unit.</p>"},{"location":"General/DeBono_Thinking_critical_critical_thinking/#getting-information-into-and-out-of-long-term-memory","title":"Getting Information Into and Out of Long-Term Memory","text":"<p>The key factor in transferring information from short-term to long-term memory is the development of associations between the new information and schemata already available in memory. This, in turn, depends upon two variables: the extent to which the information to be learned relates to an already existing schema, and the level of processing given to the new information. Depth (level) of processing refers to the amount of effort and cognitive capacity employed to process information, and the number and strength of associations that are thereby forged between the data to be learned and knowledge already in memory.</p> <p>The following illustrative tasks are listed in order of the depth of mental processing required:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Say how many letters there are in each word on the list</p> </li> <li> <p>Give a word that rhymes with each word</p> </li> <li> <p>Make a mental image of each word, make up a story that incorporates     each word.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Memory Rarely Changes Retroactively.</p> <p>Memories are seldom reassessed or reorganized retroactively in response to new information.

The exchange of appreciations is meant to help you build upon your strengths, with the underlying assumption that a creative craft is made extraordinary through developing your strengths rather than obsessing over your weaknesses.

Groups will keep working so long as no member becomes a victim of stereotyping. The way to head off fight or flight is to help people experience their differences as functional rather than stereotypical. We do this by invoking subgroups if scapegoating or splitting seems probable. In conflict situations, you can go further and form temporary subgroups in which people explore their positions. Most of the time they will resolve and move on when they discover a legitimate spectrum of views, making confrontation unnecessary.</p> <p>As you apply the theory outlined here to meetings, you will discover a wholly new way of keeping groups on task regardless of their differences.

Because people keep most projections secret, even those meetings that seem smooth and orderly become a jumble of unspoken wishes, energies, and frustrated impulses. Somebody forms a judgment and be- comes part of a subgroup that includes every other person with similar thoughts. Of course, no one knows it unless you take the trouble to poll the group. There is at work an informal system functioning apart from the people in it.</p> <p>On the surface, you have people doing what they do in meetings. Underneath, each person is aligning with, distancing from, or ignoring every statement made.

We use the adjective functional here to suggest \"contributing to growth,\" not to describe people's jobs. Functional subgroups transcend the stereotypical subgroups that people form and re-form in their heads.</p> <p>So long as every person has a functional ally--- somebody who carries the same ideas and/or feelings---a group is more likely to keep working. Members will not distract themselves with side trips into rejecting, rescuing, or scapegoating those who take risks. Our minimal job becomes helping people experience functional differences when stereotypes might prevail. If we do this job right, group members will take care of the rest.</p> <p>When we lead meetings, we just stand there so long as people stay with the task.

We judge the impact of such statements by the extent to which tension rises in the group.</p> <p>PARTICIPANT: We have been at this for 2 hours, and I'm frustrated that we haven't made more progress!</p> <p>Try to build an informal subgroup for the person that made a statement. For many people, this will be counterintuitive. Rather than look for somebody who is not frustrated to counterbalance the person that made the statement, your best move is to get the person that made the statement joined by people that share the same opinion.</p> <p>LEADER: Anyone else feeling frustrated?</p> <p>We expect one or more people to raise their hands. When they do, we ask for their experience. Usually we discover they have a spectrum of frustrations. Speakers see that they are not alone. Frustration is OK. Confrontation is avoided. Everyone has new information on where others stand. The group moves on. Sometimes, however, people ignore the frustrated per- son, moving on to other topics, leaving emotionality hanging like fog in the air.</p> <p>LEADER (recognizing the un\ufb01nished feelings): I want to go back to what _____ said a minute ago. Is anyone else feeling frustrated?</p> <p>LEADER (to those nodding): What do you experience?</p> <p>One person gives his or her version. Perhaps another chimes in. At this point the group is working again. What might have been a fight becomes a dialogue on a key issue---the degree to which the work frustrates people. This is not a denial of the reality of the person who brought up the issue.</p> <p>Rules for asking \"Anyone else\"</p> <ol> <li> <p>Listen for the intensity of feeling, and note what happens in the     group. Many statements require no response. The person making them     is satisfied to get it out, and people accept the comment as part of     the dialogue.</p> </li> <li> <p>Cite the content of a statement only when the content does not     threaten a personal attack or a divisive argument.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Note that we can't anticipate functional subgroups. We discover them as the meeting progresses. It takes only one ally to form a subgroup, validate a person's right to an opinion, and keep the meeting on track.</p> <p>In managing meetings, we need to emphasize, we are not standing there saying \"anyone else\" every few minutes.

We may wait as long as 20 seconds after asking, \"Anyone else?\" which seems like an eon longer than eternity. When nobody speaks, tension builds while we consult our experience for an honest response.</p> <p>LEADER: I've had moments here when I thought I was wasting my time, too.</p> <p>Suppose we can't authentically join.

In such cases, people may strongly disagree without stereotyping each other, but their conflict threatens to derail the task. There is a second technique we use for instances that paralyze a group. Our objective is to have people explore both sides of the conflict, but not in the way you might imagine.</p> <p>Instead of encouraging a dialogue between polarized subgroups, we stop the action and have people in Sub- group A identify themselves. We do the same with Subgroup B. Then, we encourage the A's to talk with each other while the B's listen. After all the A's have had their say, we ask Subgroup B to do the same while Subgroup A listens.</p> <p>The reason for this may not seem obvious. When people dialogue with those who are ostensibly similar, comparing notes on what they believe and why, they nearly always discover differences that were not apparent at first. There is a spectrum of views within Subgroup A (just as members of a political party vote the same way for different reasons). Often this comes as a surprise to both Sub-groups A and B. Moreover, when people listen in on conversations among those they consider different, they nearly always discover positions similar to theirs that they could not discern until now.</p> <p>In short, we affirm Yvonne Agazarian's principle that within apparent similarities, differences always exist, and within apparent differences, similarities will emerge. As people make these finer distinctions, they develop a more grounded sense of what they consider relevant. They experience a continuum of opinions rather than two opposite poles. They suspend for the time being their stereotypes and projections and get on with the business at hand. Differentiation leads to integration.

We're describing what could happen. We know that people would prefer that we, as leaders, keep everybody in Contentment or Renewal. Alas, we say, we don't know how to do that! We accept all the rooms as possibilities when you do purposeful work. We end our briefing with the hope that group members will do the same. Over the years, we have repeatedly heard people refer to the four rooms during a meeting, making legitimate their feelings, especially when things get rough. This structure makes things easier for everybody and helps us keep ourselves centered.</p> <p>Nobody likes Confusion, but in the middle of a tense meeting Confusion is not a bad place to be. Why would we con- sider it functional to live in a space no one likes? A physical/emotional state that some people take drugs to relieve? Well, we are not talking about clinical anxiety, that unfocused, nameless dread that overcomes many of us now and then and a few of us all of the time. We are talking about commonplace anxious meetings in a diverse world of non- stop change, when people wonder whether they will agree on a goal, be heard, solve the problem, make the decision, fashion the plan, cooperate, learn, and still make it home for dinner. In short, the Confusion Room has many doors. One leads back to Denial. The others welcome you to Renewal. Anxiety represents energy looking for a constructive outlet.</p>"},{"location":"General/Meetings_Dont_just_do_something_standin_there/#manage-anxiety","title":"Manage anxiety","text":""},{"location":"General/Meetings_Dont_just_do_something_standin_there/#use-the-four-rooms-of-change-in-meetings","title":"Use the Four Rooms of Change in Meetings","text":""},{"location":"General/Meetings_Dont_just_do_something_standin_there/#just-stand-there-and-breathe","title":"Just Stand There and . . .

We may project our hopes and fears on others, making them responsible for our feelings and our fate. Others do the same to us, especially when we take leadership. There are many benefits to becoming aware of your projections. Not least of these is learning to detach enough from what happens in meetings that you stop taking personally whatever people say or do.</p> <p>When you are leading a meeting, do you get agitated with people who say nothing? Or with those who won't shut up? If someone expresses anger, do you become angry? Do you sometimes suspect that people are telling you what you want to hear? Or silently judging you on criteria never made explicit? Do you sometimes decide this group is \"resistant,\" another group \"ready to work\"? Have you ever found yourself disliking, mistrusting, or ignoring somebody before you knew anything about that person? Or found yourself liking a complete stranger at first sight? In each of these scenarios, you are caught up in the experience of projection. You attribute to things and people \"out there\" qualities that originate in you. Whether they have any basis in fact is irrelevant when you are projecting.</p> <p></p> <p>Now comes the tricky part. To keep your projections from leading you to act unskillfully, own as many of them as you can. By \"owning,\" we mean experiencing yourself with awareness, accepting traits that you don't like along with the ones that you do.

Our senses provide the factual information. Our brains turn sensory evidence (sights, sounds, smells, etc.) into personal perceptions (\"percepts\"), each one of which is unique. Every external stimulus sends an instant message to the brain, which compares the new sensation with those stored in memory. Our brains then form an image to reinterpret the experience in a way that satisfies us. Every experience we have from \"out there\" we turn into a percept \"in here.\" We tell ourselves a story and act as if it is true.</p> <p>1. You choose your own judgments, fears, and fantasies. Nobody does anything to you. You \"do\" your- self. You may be tempted, for example, to imagine some group members are \"undermining\" your agenda.

There are n people present in a room. Prove that among them there are two people who have the same number of people they know in the room.</p> <p>Solution. Each person may have between 0 and n \u2212 1 acquaintances (inclusive). We imagine labelling each person with the number of acquaintances that person has. We have n people, and n possible values for the labels. We would like to show that some two people have the same label value. If there were more people than label values, we would be \ufb01nished. But since there is the same number of label values as people, we appear to be stuck. However, observe that the only way that no two people have the same label value is that everyone has a di\ufb00erent label. Thus one person knows nobody, one person knows 1 person, and so on, and \ufb01nally one person knows n \u2212 1 people. But this last person then knows everyone else, and in particular this means that there cannot be a person who knows nobody. This contradiction shows that there must indeed be two people who have the same number of acquaintances in the room.</p> <p>7.

This version is \"the maximum value is at least the average value, for any non-empty finite bag of real numbers\" (thanks Professor Dijkstra)</p> <p>Do not let the math jargon intimidate you. The idea is intuitive. For typical data sets, the average is the \"middle\" value, so clearly the maximum should be at least as big. While this version sounds different, it is mathematically the same as the one stated with pigeons and pigeonholes.</p> <p>Consider again the problem of stuffing pigeons into pigeonholes and consider the average. If we have more than n pigeons and n pigeonholes, then the average value of (pigeons / pigeonholes) is greater than one. This means the maximum value should also be larger than one. In other words, there has to be some value of more than one pigeons per pigeonhole.

It\\'s a principle-centered, character-based, \\\"Inside-Out\\\" approach to personal and interpersonal effectiveness. \\\"Inside-Out\\\" means to start first with self; even more fundamentally, to start with the most inside part of self -- with your paradigms, your character, and your motives.</p> <p>It says if you want to have a happy marriage, be the kind of person who generates positive energy and sidesteps negative energy rather than empowering it. If you want to have a more pleasant, cooperative teenager, be a more understanding, empathic, consistent, loving parent. If you want to have more freedom, more latitude in your job, be a more responsible, a more helpful, a more contributing employee. If you want to be trusted, be trustworthy. If you want the secondary greatness of recognized talent, focus first on primary greatness of character.</p> <p>The Inside-Out approach says that Private Victories precede Public Victories, that making and keeping promises to ourselves precedes making and keeping promises to others. It says it is futile to put personality ahead of character, to try to improve relationships with others before improving ourselves.</p> <p>But shortly after World War I the basic view of success shifted from the character ethic to what we might call the personality ethic. Success became more a function of personality, of public image, of attitudes and behaviors, skills and techniques that lubricate the processes of human interaction. This personality ethic essentially took two paths: one was human and public relations techniques and the other was positive mental attitude (PMA).</p> <p>This brings into focus one of the basic flaws of the personality ethic. To try to change outward attitudes and behaviors does very little good in the long run if we fail to examine the basic paradigms from which those attitudes and behaviors flow.</p> <p>We see the world, not as it is, but as we are -- or, as we are conditioned to see it. When we open our mouths to describe what we see, we in effect describe ourselves, our perceptions, our paradigms. When other people disagree with us, we immediately think something is wrong with them. Sincere, clearheaded people see things differently, each looking through the unique lens of experience.</p> <p>The more aware we are of our basic paradigms, maps, or assumptions, and the extent to which we have been influenced by our experience, the more we can take responsibility for those paradigms, examine them, test them against reality, listen to others and be open to their perceptions, thereby getting a larger picture and a far more objective view.</p> <p>The more closely our maps or paradigms are aligned with these principles or natural laws, the more accurate and functional they will be. Correct maps will infinitely impact our personal and interpersonal effectiveness far more than any amount of effort expended on changing our attitudes and behaviors.</p> <p>Our level of development is fairly obvious with tennis or piano playing, where it is impossible to pretend. But it is not so obvious in the areas of character and emotional development. We can \\\"pose\\\" and \\\"put on\\\" for a stranger or an associate. We can pretend. And for a while we can get by with it -- at least in public.</p> <p>Habits are powerful factors in our lives. Because they are consistent, often unconscious patterns, they constantly, daily, express our character and produce our effectiveness or ineffectiveness.</p> <p>For our purposes, we will define a habit as the intersection of knowledge, skill, and desire. Knowledge is the theoretical paradigm, the what to do and the why. Skill is the how to do. And desire is the motivation, the want to do. In order to make something a habit in our lives, we have to have all three.</p> <p>Dependent people need others to get what they want. Independent people can get what they want through their own effort. Interdependent people combine their own efforts with the efforts of others to achieve their greatest success.</p> <p>Interdependence is a far more mature, more advanced concept. If I am physically interdependent, I am self-reliant and capable, but I also realize that you and I working together can accomplish far more than, even at my best, I could accomplish alone. If I am emotionally interdependent, I derive a great sense of worth within myself, but I also recognize the need for love, for giving, and for receiving love from others. If I am intellectually interdependent, I realize that I need the best thinking of other people to join with my own.</p> <p>Dependent people cannot choose to become interdependent. They don\\'t have the character to do it; they don\\'t own enough of themselves.</p> <p>That\\'s why Habits 1, 2, and 3 move a person from dependence to independence. They are the \\\"Private Victories,\\\" the essence of character growth.</p>"},{"location":"Personal_Development/7_habits_of_highly_effective_people/#the-habits","title":"The habits","text":"<p>They are also habits of effectiveness because they are based on a paradigm of effectiveness that is in harmony with a natural law, a principle I call the \\\"P/PC Balance,\\\" which many people break themselves against. This principle can be easily understood by remembering Aesop\\'s fable of the Goose and the Golden Egg</p> <p>As the story shows, true effectiveness is a function of two things: what is produced (the golden eggs) and the producing asset or capacity to produce (the goose).</p> <p>Effectiveness lies in the balance -- what I call the P/PC Balance TM. P stands for production of desired results, the golden eggs. PC stands for production capability, the ability or asset that produces the golden eggs.</p> <p>In our quest for short-term returns, or results, we often ruin a prized physical asset -- a car, a computer, a washer or dryer, even our body or our environment. Keeping P and PC in balance makes a tremendous difference in the effective use of physical assets.</p> <p>To maintain the P/PC Balance, the balance between the golden egg (Production) and the health and welfare of the goose (Production Capability) is often a difficult judgment call.

Look at the word responsibility -- \\\"response-ability\\\" -- the ability to choose your response. Highly proactive people recognize that responsibility. They do not blame circumstances, conditions, or conditioning for their behavior. Their behavior is a product of their own conscious choice, based on values, rather than a product of their conditions, based on feeling.</p> <p>Proactive people can carry their own weather with them.

They are value driven; and if their value is to produce good quality work, it isn\\'t a function of whether the weather is conducive to it or not.</p> <p>The ability to subordinate an impulse to a value is the essence of the proactive person. Reactive people are driven by feelings, by circumstances, by conditions, by their environment. Proactive people are driven by values -- carefully thought about, selected and internalized values.</p> <p>Proactive people are still influenced by external stimuli, whether physical, social, or psychological. But their response to the stimuli, conscious or unconscious, is a value-based choice or response. As Eleanor Roosevelt observed, \\\"No one can hurt you without your consent.\\\" In the words of Gandhi, \\\"They cannot take away our self-respect if we do not give it to them.\\\" It is our willing permission, our consent to what happens to us, that hurts us far more than what happens to us in the first place.</p> <p>The proactive approach is to change from the Inside-Out: to be different, and by being different, to effect positive change in what\\'s out there -- I can be more resourceful, I can be more diligent, I can be more creative, I can be more cooperative.</p> <p>While we are free to choose our actions, we are not free to choose the consequences of those actions.</p> <p>We can make a promise -- and keep it.

The key to the ability to change is a changeless sense of who you are, what you are about and what you value. With a mission statement, we can flow with changes. We don\\'t need prejudgments or prejudices. We don\\'t need to figure out everything else in life, to stereotype and categorize everything and everybody in order to accommodate reality</p> <p>In order to write a personal mission statement, we must begin at the very center of our Circle of Influence, that center comprised of our most basic our paradigms, the lens through which we see the world.</p> <p>It is here that we deal with our vision and our values. It is here that we use our endowment of self-awareness to examine our maps and, if we value correct principles, to make certain that our maps accurately describe the territory, that our paradigms are based on principles and reality</p> <p>These four factors -- security, guidance, wisdom, and power -- are interdependent. Security and clear guidance bring true wisdom, and wisdom becomes the spark or catalyst to release and direct power. When these four factors are present together, harmonized and enlivened by each other, they create the great force of a noble personality, a balanced character, a beautifully integrated individual.</p> <p>Principles don\\'t react to anything. They won\\'t divorce us or run away with our best friend. They aren\\'t out to get us. They can\\'t pave our way with shortcuts and quick fixes. They don\\'t depend on the behavior of others, the environment, or the current fad for their validity. Principles don\\'t die.</p> <p>Frankl says we detect rather than invent our missions in life. I like that choice of words. I think each of us has an internal monitor or sense, a conscience that gives us an awareness of our own uniqueness and the singular contributions that we can make. In Frankl\\'s words, \\\"Everyone has his own specific vocation or mission in life. Therein he cannot be replaced, nor can his life be repeated. Thus, everyone\\'s task is as unique as is his specific opportunity to implement it.</p> <p>A mission statement is not something you write overnight. It takes deep introspection, careful analysis, thoughtful expression, and often many rewrites to produce it in final form. It may take you several weeks or even months before you feel really comfortable with it, before you feel it is a complete and concise expression of your innermost values and directions. Even then, you will want to review it regularly and make minor changes as the years bring additional insights or changing circumstances. But fundamentally, your mission statement becomes your constitution, the solid expression of your vision and values. It becomes the criterion by which you measure everything else in your life.</p>"},{"location":"Personal_Development/7_habits_of_highly_effective_people/#habit-3-put-first-things-first","title":"Habit 3: Put First Things First","text":"<p>Habit 3, then, is the second creation -- the physical creation.

If you haven\\'t really given serious thought to the roles in your     life, you can write down what immediately comes to mind. You have a     role as an individual. You may want to list one or more roles as a     family member -- a husband or wife, mother or father, son or     daughter, a member of the extended family of grandparents, aunts,     uncles, and cousins. You may want to list a few roles in your work,     indicating different areas in which you wish to invest time and     energy on a regular basis. You may have roles in church or community     affairs. e.g.:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Individual</p> </li> <li> <p>Husband/Father</p> </li> <li> <p>Manager New Products</p> </li> <li> <p>Chairman United Way</p> </li> </ol> </li> </ol> <pre><code>&lt;!-- --&gt;\n</code></pre> <ol> <li> <p>Personal Development</p> </li> <li> <p>Wife</p> </li> <li> <p>Mother</p> </li> <li> <p>Real Estate Salesperson</p> </li> </ol> <pre><code>&lt;!-- --&gt;\n</code></pre> <ol> <li> <p>Selecting Goals: The next step is to think of two or three important     results you feel you should accomplish in each role during the next     seven days. These would be recorded as goals. At least some of these     goals should reflect Quadrant II activities. Ideally, these     short-term goals would be tied to the longer-term goals you have     identified in conjunction with your personal mission statement. But     even if you haven\\'t written your mission statement, you can get a     feeling, a sense, of what is important as you consider each of your     roles and two or three goals for each role.</p> </li> <li> <p>Scheduling: Now you look at the week ahead with your goals in mind     and schedule time to achieve them. For example, if your goal is to     produce the first draft of your personal mission statement, you may     want to set aside a two-hour block of time on Sunday to work on it.     Sunday (or some other day of the week that is special to you, your     faith, or your circumstances) is often the ideal time to plan your     more personally uplifting activities, including weekly organizing.     It\\'s a good time to draw back, to see inspiration, to look at your     life in the context of principles and values. If you set a goal to     become physically fit through exercise, you may want to set aside an     hour three or four days during the week, or possibly every day     during the week, to accomplish that goal. There are some goals that     you may only be able to accomplish during business hours, or some     that you can only do on Saturday when your children are home. Can     you begin to see some of the advantages of organizing the week     instead of the day?</p> </li> <li> <p>Daily Adapting: With Quadrant II weekly organizing, daily planning     becomes more a function of daily adapting, or prioritizing     activities and responding to unanticipated events, relationships,     and experiences in a meaningful way. Taking a few minutes each     morning to review your schedule can put you in touch with the     value-based decisions you made as you organized the week as well as     unanticipated factors that may have come up. As you overview the     day, you can see that your roles and goals provide a natural     prioritization that grows out of your innate sense of balance. It is     a softer, more right-brain prioritization that ultimately comes out     of your sense of personal mission.</p> </li> </ol> <p>You simply can\\'t think efficiency with people.

And whatever affection or kindness forces its way through to us, we hardly embrace it. Such overtures don't serve to comfort but, rather, to confuse us; and the ego's mandate is clear: reject others before they have a chance to reject us.</p> <p>It should come as no surprise that anger is easily triggered when we focus on our own pain and how difficult life is for us. For instance, when faced with a present or impending loss, the egocentric person grieves less for the other, and more for himself. His loss. His guilt. His woe. The less the ego is involved, the less stuck we will become, because normal feelings of sadness are processed healthily rather than suppressed, masked, or channeled away from the healing process.</p> <p>When a person suffers from low self-esteem, he takes what he needs in an attempt to make himself feel whole, which is why the last person you want trying to love you is someone who doesn't love himself. This person cannot really love, he can only control and take. The more self-esteem we have, the more complete we are. Receiving, after all, is a natural and reciprocal consequence of giving. When we only take, however, to fill a constant void, we are left empty, and are forced to continue taking in a futile quest to feel fulfilled, which only reinforces our dependency and exhausts us emotionally and physically.</p> <p>Through this paradigm, we learn how to tell whether someone has high or low self-esteem; it is reflected in how he treats himself and others. A person who lacks self-esteem may indulge in things to satisfy only his own desires, and he will not treat others particularly well (a product of an arrogant mentality). Alternatively, this person may cater to others because he craves their approval and respect, but he does not take care of his own needs (a product of the doormat mentality). Only someone who has higher self-esteem can give responsibly---love and respect---to both himself and others.</p> <p>Even a highly sensitive person who is seemingly void of ego can also be self-centered and selfish. He is absorbed in his own pain, filled with self-pity, and he can't feel anyone else's pain while drowning in his own. Such a person experiences no real connection to anyone outside of himself, despite his seemingly noble nature. Without genuine humility, he will not---cannot---burden himself unless he receives a larger payout in the form of acceptance or approval. His taking is disguised as giving. His fear is dressed up as love.</p> <p>A person who is not self-centered feels humility and a connection to others. The wall of I am me and he is he is broken down, and where there is no ego, there is connection, a bond. A person who is not self-centered feels humility and a connection to others. The wall of I am me and he is he is broken down, and where there is no ego, there is connection, a bond.</p> <p>Anger cannot exist where there is no separation, no \"I\" to get in the way, but when we are self-focused, the ego cuts the cord. Fundamentally, anger is a disconnection---to avoid pain, to inflict pain.</p> <p>Confidence is how effective we feel within a specific area or situation, while self-esteem is defined as how much we recognize our inherent worth and feel deserving of happiness and good fortune. Self-esteem is shaped by the quality of our choices rather than by the assets at our disposal. A person who attempts to fortify his self-image by taking pride in a specific trait may exhibit signs of high self-esteem to the untrained eye, but, in fact, such an individual often suffers from low self-esteem, because all he has is an inflated ego.</p> <p>Don't fall into the trap of believing that a person with an inflated ego likes himself; ego and self-esteem are inversely related. No matter how much a person appears to be happy with himself, if he is egocentric, that person suffers with feelings of inferiority.</p> <p>How someone behaves toward you is reflection of his own feelings of self-worth and has nothing to do with your intrinsic worth---unless you (the ego) decide to make it about you.</p> <p>When we suffer from low self-esteem, we're often afraid that something bad will happen to us after something good occurs in our lives. When fortune unexpectedly smiles on us, we feel anxious because of our sense of unworthiness. To alleviate our emotional tension, we might even sabotage our success so that we can fulfill our personal prophecy: The world is as we predicted. We feel secure because our beliefs---no matter how damaging and distorted---have been reaffirmed.

So findet sich zum Beispiel bei einem tugendhaften Menschen nicht so sehr eine gesunde Mischung zwischen w\u00fctendem J\u00e4hzorn und Unempfindlichkeit gegen\u00fcber \u00c4rger; vielmehr ist er in der Lage, mit der Tugend der Geduld und Sanftmut eine Wutreaktion, die automatisch abl\u00e4uft, bewusst zu kontrollieren und den auftretenden \u00c4rger auf eine Weise zu \u00e4u\u00dfern, die andere nicht verletzt.</p> <p>Jede Tugend kann lediglich vorgespielt und geheuchelt sein.

Der Begr\u00fcnder des abendl\u00e4ndischen M\u00f6nchstums, Benedikt von Nursia, beschreibt im siebten Kapitel seiner Regel zw\u00f6lf Stufen der Demut, Die ersten Schritte in der Entwicklung der Demut beziehen sich somit auf die richtige spirituelle Verankerung. Je h\u00f6her wir steigen, desto mehr verk\u00f6rpert sich die Demut auch bis hinab ins Leibliche.</p> <p>1. Gottesfurcht: Die Gottesfurcht ist somit nichts anders als unbedingte Liebe zu Gott, wozu die St\u00e4rke notwendig ist, stets das Gute zu tun und das B\u00f6se zu meiden.</p> <p>2. Willenlosigkeit: Auf der zweiten Stufe soll man den eigenen Willen nicht lieben und sich nicht in der Befriedigung seiner W\u00fcnsche gefallen. Statt eifrig immer neue Ziele zu verfolgen, die nur dem eigenen Stolz dienen, erm\u00f6glicht das Loslassen der aktiven Willenst\u00e4tigkeit eine \u00d6ffnung f\u00fcr das reale Leben, das gr\u00f6\u00dfer und sch\u00f6ner ist, als sich das kleine Ich ertr\u00e4umen k\u00f6nnte.</p> <p>3. Gehorsam: Gehorsam im spirituellen Sinn bedeutet die F\u00e4higkeit, auf die innere Stimme zu horchen. Der Gehorsam erm\u00f6glicht es, dass dasjenige, das klein ist, sich demjenigen unterordnet, das gro\u00df ist. Dadurch wird der Hochmut unm\u00f6glich gemacht, denn dieser beruht auf einer Verwechslung des Kleinen mit dem Gro\u00dfen. Wir \u00f6ffnen uns f\u00fcr die hilfreiche F\u00fchrung durch andere Menschen, die auf dem Pfad der Demut vielleicht schon weiter vorangeschritten sind.</p> <p>4. Geduld: Die vierte Stufe der Demut erm\u00f6glicht es, widrige Umst\u00e4nde geduldig anzunehmen, sie als notwendige Pr\u00fcfungen zu verstehen und sogar still und selbstbeherrscht auszuharren, wenn einem Unrecht getan wurde. Ohne zu ermatten oder uns zu entziehen, entwickeln wir die F\u00e4higkeit zur geduldigen Akzeptanz, indem wir versuchen, den Wert aller Ereignisse zu ergr\u00fcnden, auch der unangenehmen und schmerzhaften.</p> <p>5. Wahrhaftigkeit: Statt dass wir uns selbst etwas vormachen und anderen etwas vorspielen, sind wir bereit, ehrlich unsere Unzul\u00e4nglichkeiten anzuschauen und uns stets zu fragen, ob wir Unrecht getan haben. Indem wir unsere M\u00e4ngel einer Person des Vertrauens offen mitteilen, verstecken wir uns nicht, sondern entwickeln den Mut zur Authentizit\u00e4t und Integrit\u00e4t.</p> <p>6. Bescheidenheit Es geht vielmehr darum, seinen ma\u00dflosen Egoismus zur\u00fcckzunehmen und sich nicht zu scheuen, auch kleine, glanzlose Arbeiten ohne Aussicht auf Ruhm zufrieden und heiter auszuf\u00fchren. Auch niedrige Arbeiten k\u00f6nnen Spa\u00df machen. Auch einfache Lebensverh\u00e4ltnisse k\u00f6nnen begl\u00fccken. So stellt sich langsam die F\u00e4higkeit zur heiteren Gen\u00fcgsamkeit ein.</p> <p>7. Selbstlosigkeit: Hier entwickelt sich die F\u00e4higkeit, seine ganze ichbezogene Pers\u00f6nlichkeit mit ihrem Anspruch auf Durchsetzung, Kontrolle und Macht loszulassen. Das Ich verzichtet auf jegliche Anspruchshaltung sowie auf Verteidigung..</p> <p>8. Lernbereitschaft: Es geht um die F\u00e4higkeit und den Willen, von denjenigen zu lernen, die mehr wissen und erlebt haben als ich, die weiser und dem\u00fctiger sind. Dies schlie\u00dft auch die Bereitschaft ein, sich f\u00fcr neue und zun\u00e4chst vielleicht ungewohnte Dinge zu \u00f6ffnen, anstatt alles immer besser zu wissen und nur das h\u00f6ren und lernen zu wollen, was man ohnehin schon wei\u00df.</p> <p>9. Schweigen: sich von der st\u00e4ndig kommentierenden und alles besser wissenden Stimme des urteilenden Verstandes zu distanzieren und still zu werden, um die leise Stimme des Herzens besser zu h\u00f6ren. Zugleich f\u00fchrt das Schweigen im zwischenmenschlichen Verkehr dazu, dass man sich mit Urteilen erst einmal zur\u00fcckh\u00e4lt, um m\u00f6glichst unvoreingenommen hinzuh\u00f6ren.</p> <p>10. Ernsthaftigkeit: Nur eine ruhige, ernsthafte Haltung macht es m\u00f6glich, dass die Demut auch bis in den K\u00f6rper hinein vordringen kann. Aus der stillen Ernsthaftigkeit und Tiefsinnigkeit heraus kann dann aber durchaus Humor entstehen, und es darf auch lautes, herzhaftes Lachen ert\u00f6nen. Es ist dies ein ganz anderer, feinf\u00fchligerer Humor, Ausdruck einer heiteren Seele und eines gel\u00f6sten Leibes.</p> <p>11. Ruhige Rede: Benedikt empfiehlt eine ruhige, bescheidene Rede und dass man nur wenig und wohlbedacht sprechen soll. Statt loszul\u00e4rmen, drauflos zu plappern und pausenlos zu schnattern, verbreitet der dem\u00fctige Mensch mit seiner Rede eine Stimmung um sich herum, die andere in die Stille und in die Demut einl\u00e4dt.</p> <p>12. Verneigung: Als bewusste Geste und \u00dcbung kann aber das Verneigen des Hauptes noch tiefer in die Demut hineinf\u00fchren.

Based on thousands of years of practice, mindfulness techniques enable people to manage their attention, improve their awareness, and sharpen their focus and clarity.</p> <p>A mind in balance, which sees reality clearly and values ethics.</p> <p>Life is about results. Results come from our actions. Our actions come from the choices we make. Our choices come from the thoughts we think.</p> <p></p> <p>We are living in an \"attention economy\" where the ability to man- age our attention and the quality of our attention is key to our success. But in the digital age, where our ability to pay attention at will is under siege, we have a problem.</p> <p>But from a neurological perspective, we're not capable of focusing attention on two things at the same time. When we think we are multitasking, what we are doing in reality is shift-tasking : shifting attention rapidly between two or more things.</p> <p>Mindfulness is about you. It's about overcoming the multitasking trap, and entering the attention economy being one second ahead of your wandering mind and external distractions. It's about generating greater mental effectiveness so that you can reach your full potential, both on a professional and a personal level. Effectiveness in this context is the ability to achieve your goals, objectives, and wishes in life.</p> <p>The central characteristics of mindfulness are sharp focus and open awareness. Sharp focus is the ability to concentrate single-pointedly on any object of choice for a long as you want with minimal effort. Training sharp focus provides the benefit of being fully present with other people or tasks. Open awareness is the ability to see clearly what is happening in your mind and make wise choices about where to focus your attention. Through training open awareness, you gain clarity. The clutter from the outer world and from your own mind is reduced. As you become more insightful, even the most difficult problems appear less complex and become easier to handle. Optimal effectiveness is achieved when people are simultaneously sharply focused and openly aware.</p>"},{"location":"Personal_Development/MIndfullness_at_work/#rule-1-focus-on-what-you-choose","title":"Rule #1: Focus on What You Choose","text":"<p>Staying focused on the object of your choice is the first rule of mental effectiveness.

Should I deal with this distraction now or let it go? This doesn't mean you keep working on the task and shift your atten- tion back and forth between your boss and your task. That would be multitasking, and we already know that doesn't work. Instead, Rule #2 requires consciously choosing to let go of the task you were working on and focusing your full attention on your boss. Rule #1 becomes re- engaged at this point.</p> <p></p> <ol> <li> <p>As the first quadrant shows, when you are focused but on autopilot,     your state of mind can be described as being in \"flow.\" Some people     prefer to be in this state, especially when they're tackling routine     tasks or physical work. Flow is characterized by some degree of     absorption and therefore lacking awareness of external distractions.     This can pose a problem even during routine work, because you may     neglect sensory signals of important events around you or     physiological signals indicating you need rest, movement, or food.     We need awareness to pick up on relevant distractions---like our     boss coming into our office</p> </li> <li> <p>In the second quadrant---defined as \"mindful\"---we have the greatest     mental bandwidth to complete tasks and the highest quality of     interactions with our environment and other people.

It helps us when we encounter difficult situations and is crucial     when we want to optimize our performance at work.

It's the best response to the digital age and a way of improving     your performance in an attention economy.</p> </li> <li> <p>In the third quadrant, you're neither focused nor aware. Some people     see this quadrant as the most relaxing. Taking a closer look,     though, you may find that is not the case. Next time you find     yourself day- dreaming on distracted autopilot, check in with your     experience: are you truly relaxed? With a bit of training you will     see that a focused mind is much more relaxed than a distracted mind.</p> </li> <li> <p>In the fourth quadrant, you're aware but easily distracted. There     can be benefits to loosening focus and allowing random thoughts to     bubble up. Some people find that they come up with more creative     ideas in this quadrant.

This way, you can easily maintain a focused and steady rhythm for long periods. It's often easier than just focusing on your breathing.</p> <p>Focus and rhythm can be a big help, especially if you feel poorly or experience pain. Most unpleasantness comes from our thoughts. Thoughts come from physical sensations or other distractions. Your focus creates your reality. Focus on unpleasantness, and your reality will be unpleasant. Instead, focus on your breathing and rhythm---and experience one moment at a time. As distractions appear, don't try to suppress them. Simply take one moment after the other: one step after the other. Inhale and exhale. Don't think about how much time you have left. Stay in the moment. With relaxed focus, any unpleasantness or pain will diminish.</p>"},{"location":"Personal_Development/MIndfullness_at_work/#performance-breaks","title":"Performance breaks","text":"<p>A mindful performance break is basically a very brief mindfulness training session.

There's no such thing as the ideal training. There's more than one life goal. There's no perfect business strategy, no optimal stock portfolio, no one right job. They're all myths. The truth is that you begin with one set-up and then constantly adjust it. The more complicated the world becomes, the less important your starting point is.

No sleeping on it, no putting it off until you've seen all the applicants. The decision you make straight after the interview cannot be overridden. How do you proceed?</p> <p>This question is known among mathematicians by a politically incorrect label: the secretary problem. Surprisingly, there is only one optimal solution. You should interview the first thirty-seven candidates and reject them all; meanwhile, however, you should be monitoring their quality. Then keep interviewing until you find someone who is better than the top applicant out of the previous thirty-seven. Hire her. You'll be making an excellent decision. She may not be the very best of the hundred applicants, but she's sure to be a solid choice. Every other approach has been shown to produce statistically worse results.</p> <p>What is it about the number thirty-seven? Thirty-seven is 100 divided by the mathematical constant e (2.718).

In TCP, a failure generally leads to retransmission rather than death, so it's considered enough for a session to begin with what's called a \"triple handshake.\" The visitor says hello, the server acknowledges the hello and says hello back, the visitor acknowledges that, and if the server receives this third message, then no further confirmation is needed and they're off to the races. Even after this initial connection is made, however, there's still a risk that some later packets may be damaged or lost in transit, or arrive out of order. In the postal mail, package delivery can be confirmed via return receipts; online, packet delivery is confirmed by what are called acknowledgment packets, or ACKs. These are critical to the functioning of the network.</p> <p>The way that ACKs work is both simple and clever. Behind the scenes of the triple handshake, each machine provides the other with a kind of serial number---and it's understood that every packet sent after that will increment those serial numbers by one each time, like checks in a checkbook. For instance, if your computer initiates contact with a web server, it might send that server, say, the number 100. The ACK sent by the server will in turn specify the serial number at which the server's own packets will be</p> <p>gin (call it 5,000), and also will say \"Ready for 101.\" Your machine's ACK will carry the number 101 and will convey in turn \"Ready for 5,001.\" (Note that these two numbering schemes are totally independent, and the number that begins each sequence is typically chosen at random.)</p> <p>This mechanism offers a ready way to pinpoint when packets have gone astray. If the server is expecting 101 but instead gets 102, it will send an ACK to packet 102 that still says \"Ready for 101.\" If it next gets packet 103, it will say, again, \"Ready for 101.\" Three such redundant ACKs in a row would signal to your machine that 101 isn't just delayed but hopelessly gone, so it will resend that packet. At that point, the server (which has kept packets 102 and 103) will send an ACK saying \"Ready for 104\" to signal that the sequence has been restored.</p>"},{"location":"Process_System_Models/Mental_Models/#tcp-congestion-handling","title":"TCP congestion handling","text":"<p>At the heart of TCP congestion control is an algorithm called Additive Increase, Multiplicative Decrease, or AIMD.

But as soon as any packet's ACK does not come back to the sender, the AIMD algorithm takes over. Under AIMD, any fully received batch of packets causes the number of packets in flight not to double but merely to increase by 1, and dropped packets cause the transmission rate to cut back by half (hence the name Additive Increase, Multiplicative Decrease). Essentially, AIMD takes the form of someone saying, \"A little more, a little more, a little more, whoa, too much, cut way back, okay a little more, a little more...\" Thus it leads to a characteristic bandwidth shape known as the \"TCP sawtooth\"---steady upward climbs punctuated by steep drops.</p>"},{"location":"Process_System_Models/Mental_Models/#_1","title":"Exponential backoff","text":""},{"location":"Process_System_Models/Mental_Models/#scheduling","title":"Scheduling","text":"<p>In fact, the weighted version of Shortest Processing Time is a pretty good candidate for best general-purpose scheduling strategy in the face of uncertainty.

The Services constellation's model is called \"CMMI for Services\" or \"CMMI-SVC.\"</p> <p>CMMI-SVC draws on concepts and practices from CMMI and other service focused standards and models, including the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL)</p> </li> <li> <p>ISO/IEC 20000: Information Technology---Service Management</p> </li> <li> <p>Control Objectives for Information and related Technology (CobiT)</p> </li> <li> <p>Information Technology Services Capability Maturity Model (ITSCMM)</p> </li> </ul> <p>The CMMI-SVC model covers the activities required to establish, deliver, and manage services. As defined in the CMMI context, a service is an intangible, non-storable product. The CMMI-SVC model has been developed to be compatible with this broad definition.</p> <p>The Software Engineering Institute (SEI) has found several dimensions that an organization can focus on to improve its business.</p> <p>Organizations typically focus on:</p> <ul> <li> <p>People</p> </li> <li> <p>procedures and methods</p> </li> <li> <p>tools and equipment</p> </li> </ul> <p></p> <p>What holds everything together?

Conversely, an absent or weak performance attribute reduces customer satisfaction. Of the needs customers verbalise, most will fall into the category of performance attributes. These attributes will form the weighted needs against which product concepts will be evaluated.</p> <p>The price for which customer is willing to pay for a product is closely tied to performance attributes. For example, customers would be willing to pay more for a car that provides them with better fuel economy.</p> <p>Delighters Excitement attributes are unspoken and unexpected by customers but can result in high levels of customer satisfaction, however their absence does not lead to dissatisfaction. Excitement attributes often satisfy latent needs real needs of which customers are currently unaware. In a competitive marketplace where manufacturer products provide similar performance, providing excitement attributes that address unknown needs can provide a competitive advantage. Although they have followed the typical evolution to a performance then a threshold attribute, cup holders were initially excitement attributes. If the requirement is absent, it does not cause dissatisfaction, but it will delight clients if present</p> <p>Other Attributes: Products often have attributes that cannot be classified according to the Kano Model. These attributes are often of little or no consequence to the customer, and do not factor into consumer decisions. An example of this type of attribute is a plate listing part numbers can be found under the hood on many vehicles for use by repairpersons</p> <p>A relatively simple approach to applying the Kano Model Analysis is to ask customers two simple questions for each attribute (Satisfied, Neutral (should be that way), Dissatisfied, does not affect my satisfaction):</p> <p>1. Rate your satisfaction if the product has this attribute?; and</p> <p>2. Rate your satisfaction if the product did not have this attribute?</p> <ul> <li>Basic attributes generally receive the \"Neutral\" response to     Question 1 and the Dissatisfied response to Question 2. Exclusion of     these attributes in the product has the potential to severely impact     the success of the product in the marketplace.</li> </ul> <p>Eliminate or include performance or excitement attributes that their presence or absence respectively lead to customer dissatisfaction. This often requires a trade-off analysis against cost. As Customers frequently rate most attributes or functionality as important, asking the question How much extra would you be willing to pay for this attribute or more of this attribute? will aid in trade-off decisions, especially for performance attributes.

The only difference is that we use Cpk when the product average is not the same as the customer nominal specification.</p> <p>The arithmetic for CR develops one number such as 1.33 to describe the capability of the process. The arithmetic for Cpk develops two numbers:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The capability index for lower specification (CPL) describes the     capability of the process in relation to the lower specification.</p> </li> <li> <p>The capability index for upper specification (CPU) describes the     capability of the process in relation to the upper specification.</p> </li> <li> <p>One number, the lower number of CPL and CPU, is used to describe the     capability of the process, and it is termed Cpk.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The question for management now becomes how to determine the Cpk when the average is not on nominal while maintaining the industry standard minimum Cpk of 1.33.</p> <p>The answer is rather simple. Because the center of the normal curve will no longer be on the nominal, the distance between product average and the lower and upper specifications will no longer be equal. If the distances are not equal, we now have two numbers to describe the capability of the process. These numbers will take into account:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The customer's lower specification, nominal, and upper specification</p> </li> <li> <p>The product average</p> </li> <li> <p>The amount of wall thickness variation about the product average</p> </li> </ul> <p>One number will describe the distance from the low end of the product variation to the lower specification, and the other number will describe the distance from the high end of the product variation to the upper specification. These numbers are called the CPL and the CPU.</p> <p>Convention mandates that if either one of these two numbers is less than 1.33, we cannot call the process capable.</p> <p>If management decided to change the SOP and place the wall thickness average at 0.26, the arithmetic to determine the CPL and the CPU would be as follows:</p> <p>CPL = Product Average -- Lower Specification \u00f7 \u00bd Total Variation</p> <p>CPL = (0.26 -- 0.255) \u00f7 \u00bd \u00d7 (0.006)</p> <p>CPL = 0.005 \u00f7 0.003</p> <p>CPL = 1.66</p> <p>CPU = Upper Specification -- Product Average \u00f7 \u00bd Total Variation</p> <p>CPU = (0.285 -- 0.260) \u00f7 \u00bd \u00d7 (0.006)</p> <p>CPU = 0.025 \u00f7 0.003</p> <p>CPU = 8.33</p> <p></p> <p>Generally speaking, product problems on the shop floor or at the customer or supplier fall into one of two categories. The problem can be one of instability or of incapability. Specifically, the problem exists because the product average has shifted or because the product has too much variation about a consistent average.</p> <p></p> <p>The purpose of a process capability study is to determine if the manufacturing process is stable and capable by measuring the critical product characteristic of interest. The product measurements are then used to develop a statistical product control chart. By analyzing the data patterns on the control chart, we determine if the process is stable. If the process is stable, we then use the data to determine a Cpk value in order to determine the degree of capability.</p> <p>It is impossible to determine if a manufacturing process is stable if the measurement process used to measure the product is not stable. This is because an unstable measurement process will make a perfectly stable manufacturing process appear to be unstable.

That is why you should try to spend a realistic amount of time on the formulation of the problem! 30% (or even more) of the total project time can easily be devoted to precise definition of the problem, especially with complex problems involving new technologies and/or many different actors with conflicting interests.</p> <p>At the basis of a problem, there are two situations: the current, or future, undesired situation, and the desired situation that a particular actor wishes to be in. The difference between the undesired and the desired situations is called 'the gap' that should be bridged by the actor. However, when trying to get from the undesired situation to the desired one, there will always be a downside to the desired situation, an effect that the actor does not like, even if his wish for the desired situation has come about. This 'unwanted downside' to the desired situation we call 'the dilemma'. The dilemma is the reason why that desired condition of the system (no noise nuisance) isn't easily accomplished.</p> <p>The dissatisfaction of our actor about the undesired situation is due to a certain condition of a system in which the problem occurs. Perhaps this dissatisfaction is about possible alternatives too, but they are not expressed in the problem statement. After all, in an analysis we want to keep our options open, and weigh up different alternatives. Focusing on certain alternatives already in the problem statement refrains us from doing so, so avoiding alternatives in the problem statement is essential to a thorough analysis.</p> <p>In looking for the dilemma in your problem, it helps when you focus on the wish of an actor (getting anywhere in the world cheaply and quickly) and how that wish is classically fulfilled (by flying, resulting in noise nuisance). Focus on what is problematic when fulfilling the actor's wish.</p> <p>Remember that a problem statement is always made from the perspective of a certain actor. For every actor you can design a unique problem statement, because every actor has different interests and thus will have different wishes. Nevertheless, the main elements that form the dilemma (and thus the problem) might naturally return several times in those problem statements.</p> <p>The art is to choose an alternative (a solution) that everybody supports with the help of an analysis that was made with all parties involved. At first it may sound strange, but you do not have to agree on what you want to accomplish (the goal) as long as you can agree on what you are going to do (the means). An increase of road taxes (alternative) on old cars can be supported by an actor because that tax increase reduces the environmental damage, as fewer old cars will be driving around. Another actor, who possibly is not interested in the environment, can support this alternative because people are then sooner inclined to discard their old car and buy a new one, eventually leading to a rise in car sales.</p> <p>Initial problem statements are good starting points for a discussion with your client or one of the other actors in the problem field. If you have formulated an initial theoretically correct problem statement, it is easier for them to give a short reaction, rather than an elaborate story about what they think is the problem.</p> <p>A useful way of presenting problem statements is to list the tensions and dilemmas different actors face. Many actors will then realize they feel the same dilemma, but only the other way around. Someone wants to reduce Co2 emissions, but fears for the country's electricity production. Someone else wants to keep the electricity production up to keep up with expected required future capacity, but fears it might come at the cost of emitting more Co2</p> <p></p> <p>Common mistakes when formulating problem statements:</p> <ol> <li>No dilemma -- every problem statement should contain both a gap     (a difference between a desired condition of a system and a deferred     current, or possible expected future, condition of a system) and a     dilemma (a reason why that desired condition of the system isn't     easily accomplished). Formulations without dilemma do not describe a     problem. In other words, you know what someone wants but not why he     cannot accomplish it. Because you do not know where the problem     lies, you don't know what to focus on. As an analyst you will not     show that you have sufficient knowledge of the system that you are     analyzing, so your credibility eventually decreases. You will get     less information, less co-operation, and, in the end, your analysis     will fail.</li> </ol> <p>Problem statements without dilemmas are for example: 'We want to reduce the emission of harmful substances', 'How can we reduce the traffic jams?' or 'How can we increase our profit?'</p> <p>A characteristic of such formulations, without dilemmas, is that they can be solved with simple and 'strange' alternatives. In the examples named above, for example, close off the chimney, prohibit driving or rob a bank.</p> <ol> <li>No wish or 'gap' -- At first it is hard to see what a problem     statement is without a wish. Nevertheless these statements occur     frequently. They usually involve people that put the blame for a lot     of things on other parties, other people, and other actors. They     only mention reasons why something can't be accomplished. You could     call these people 'complainers'.</li> </ol> <p>Because you do not know what to accomplish with such a problem statement, it is impossible to know what system to focus on, or how you can measure whether a system's condition is improving, and you do not know what kind of alternatives are actually possible.</p> <p>Problem statements without a wish or a 'gap' are, for example: ' i t is clear that we need a highway here, but they don't want to cooperate', 'We cannot reduce residential waste without the commitment of the citizens' or 'We would like to give the harbor a 'facelift', but the municipality won't make a budget available for us.</p> <ol> <li>An apparent dilemma -- 'We want to generate environmental     friendly electricity without increasing C o 2 emissions', 'How can     we produce more efficiently without increasing the production     costs?' or 'What can we do about the traffic jams without everything     getting jammed?' All these problem statements seem to have both a     wish and a dilemma, but when you look closer you will actually find     that there isn't a real dilemma present.</li> </ol> <p>Fulfilling the wish is, in these examples, the same as solving the dilemma or the other way around: if you take care of the dilemma there is no wish anymore. Both wish and dilemma focus on the same thing. In fact there is no tension at all between the wish that a client has and the reason why that wish cannot simply be fulfilled. In his urgency to make clear what the problem is, the client or the analyst has made a mistake and has introduced the same thing twice. The same difficulties arise as in the situation of a problem statement without a dilemma: you have no idea what to focus on (and when you continue your analysis, your credibility will be questioned too).</p> <ol> <li>Double wishes and/or dilemmas -- it is also possible that people     write a problem statement that seems to be well written and     complete. let's take the following problem statement: 'How can the     municipality create more recreational facilities and better access     to the neighborhood, without creating nuisance for the inhabitants     through heavy traffic and an 'empty' neighborhood off-season?'</li> </ol> <p>Look at it closely: what is the wish here? Actually, there are two: creating more recreational facilities (of which we can think: is there a wish behind this? perhaps attracting more tourists?) and improving accessibility (by car or public transport, for example). Having two wishes in the problem statement means that you will have great difficulty finding alternatives. What if we remove the recreational facilities from the problem statement? Now the problem statement becomes 'How can the municipality create better access to the neighborhood, without creating nuisance for the inhabitants through heavy traffic and an 'empty' neighborhood off-season?' now, suddenly, there is no dilemma anymore! Of course, that should not be the case, since the municipality does experience a problem. I you encounter this type of problem statement, ask your client if there is a wish behind the description he gave. 'Better access to the neighborhood' can also relate to the wish of attracting more tourists (who are stuck in traffic right now, and choose other destinations because of this), so the problem statement might become: 'How can the municipality attract more tourists to the neighborhood, without creating traffic nuisance for the inhabitants?' This way, you have a clear view of the wish the municipality has, and the 'solution space' is wide open: a large number of different alternatives can be considered.</p> <ol> <li>Mentioning a specific alternative -- The most common mistake is     not so much the problem mentioned, but the alternative that someone     has thought of to solve that problem. If the problem is about     capacity for electricity generation, someone will talk about the     'problem' of building power plants. If the problem is about     transport capacity, people will talk about getting as many trains as     possible leaving the station per hour. People find it easier to come     up with an alternative, with advice, or with an idea, than to     actually name the problem behind it all. A problem statement with an     alternative in it causes you to think more narrowly and less     creatively about possibilities to solve the problem. People will     stay focused on that one alternative everyone has been talking about     since the beginning of the analysis. Perhaps that alternative will     eventually be implemented, but the question remains whether the     right problem was solved.</li> </ol> <p>Examples of problem statements with alternatives named in them are; 'How can we build that nuclear plant without exceeding the budget?', 'We have to get the trucks off the motorway but we also have to maintain the flexibility of the transport system' or 'That tunnel has to be built there without damaging nature too much.' in these problem statements, one will probably not think of different alternatives than different types of power plants, reducing road freight or different forms of tunnels. This is a shame because alternatives like solar energy, reducing energy usage, other logistics, rewarding chauffeurs for desirable behaviour on the road, or reducing sound nuisance by placing sound walls could possibly be good alternatives too, depending on the real gap and dilemma of this actor</p> <ol> <li>Using words like 'optimal', 'minimal', best, etc. -- People     generally tend to look for the solution to the problem. If they     think a little longer, they might want to find the best solution.     However, the problems we face are so complex, and no one can predict     what the future will bring; no one can possibly predict the best     alternative. Most likely, different actors will prefer different     alternatives. In the end our facilitation of the decision- making     process should help people to concur on a particular alternative to     implement. Not necessarily for the same reason, but as long as     people can agree on the alternative. Is this the best solution?     Probably not, and, in addition, no one can know. Tomorrow, or in a     year, the group of actors might agree on another alternative to     implement. Or even today, if the group of actors are different, but     the situation they face is the same, they might end up with a     different alternative.</li> </ol> <p>Using words like 'minimal', 'best' and 'optimal' focuses on one particular alternative, the one that scores minimally on a certain criterion, or best, or optimally. Even if it were possible to agree with the group on how to translate the value of one criterion against another (so optimization would, at least mathematically, be possible), problem statements would still focus on finding one alternative. The idea is that a rational comparison of many alternatives on a set of well-balanced criteria facilitates decision-making in such a way that the actors involved can have a clear view of different alternatives and their effects, without looking for the optimal one.</p>"},{"location":"Process_System_Models/Solving_complex_problems/#actor-objectives-analysis-criteria-for-decision-making-goal-tree","title":"Actor objectives analysis, Criteria for decision making (goal tree)","text":"<p>Actors tend to promote 'their' alternative for 'the' problem. 'Wind mills are the only serious option to tackle our energy problem, as they are really sustainable.' Usually, another actor also starts promoting his alternative, leading to lots of discussion and not bringing a shared decision for one alternative any closer. The previous Section introduced the problem statement to redirect the discussion from alternatives to the problem, mainly to keep the solution space large enough and to generate and compare several alternatives. When a list of alternatives becomes available, we would like to know to what extent they solve the problem and fit the preferences of the actors. Also, if we want to compare alternatives, we need a set of criteria with which to compare them.</p> <p>What is needed is a well-balanced set of criteria, representing all aspects (including the implicit ones) of our problem owner and other actors involved in the problem field. Although it will be clear from the beginning that it is difficult to take all criteria into account, it would be impossible for our client to make a well grounded and carefully considered decision if he is not aware of important criteria for all the actors involved.</p> <p>Remember the discussion with our problem owner about the problem statement. Especially remember the implicit dilemma he had in mind when you came up with a 'strange' solution to his problem. 'But that is not what i mean!' A clear wish and dilemma can never be represented by a single criterion. Gut, as we can guess, many more issues will be implicit in the heads of our clients. We can expect that various criteria are needed to represent all this. A structured approach to reaching these criteria is to ask 'why do you want this?' Go back to our client, our entrepreneur, who answered 'more turnover' when we asked what he wanted. We can discern several implicit thoughts behind this answer, by asking him the simple 'why?' question, over and over.</p> <p>'Why do you want more turnover?' To create more profit? And why more profit? To be able to continue the business? And why continue? Your client is an entrepreneur. To ask him why he wants to continue his business (apart from being a somewhat strange question) is to discuss the 'being' of an entrepreneur: continuing the business. Hopefully there is another, more abstract goal for our client when it comes to his life: we have reached his interest, which is always there, independent of any problem, even without the problem being perceived</p> <p></p> <p>In other words, goal trees are actor-specific. Only when all actors are involved in criteria creation (i.e., all actors have their own goal tree) can the analyst create a well-balanced set of criteria for further analysis, and which can eventually be used in the decision-making process.</p> <p>In practice, it is useful to start by making a goal tree with, and for, your client. Once this has been done, and your client agrees with the result, you can discuss whether it is necessary and possible to create goal trees for other actors as well. When you have a set of goal trees, you can decide on which criteria to include in your analyses. Do not be too picky about selecting criteria, since having too few criteria may lead to alternatives being selected which do not live up to the goals of the actors.</p> <p>What are commonly made mistakes and their effects in designing goal trees?</p> <ol> <li>Causal relations and/or verbs in the goal tree -- The most     common error that people make in constructing goal trees is that     they consider lower goals to be a means to reach higher goals. This     comes close to our human habit of thinking in solutions rather than     in problems, as we discussed earlier in this book. These people     don't answer the question 'what is cheap energy?' They identify ways     to reach cheap energy, like 'decrease production costs' or 'reduce     transport costs'. These are means to reach the goal of cheap energy,     not criteria to find out whether a certain alternative A results in     cheaper energy than another alternative</li> </ol> <p>As soon as you see verbs in a goal tree, be alert. Verbs represent actions and, thus, cannot define goals. 'Increasing the number of thermal power plants' is an action, something that is done. It is done to reach a goal, like more environmentally friendly energy. It is, however, not defining what environmentally friendly energy is: it is a way to get it! In essence, all actions like these are alternatives that might (partly) solve the problem. Of course, we have to find out whether they really have potential but, in principle, they may have. Thus, when you use verbs in a goal tree you are basically introducing alternatives and, with this, creating substantial bias in your analysis.</p> <ol> <li>Goal tree contains alternatives -- often, people     'Operationalize' objectives like 'environmentally friendly energy'     in terms of 'more photovoltaic cells' and 'more wind mills'.     However, these are two alternatives that in this problem some of the     actors will consider as being 'the' solution. It is alternatives     like these that we want to compare, or rationalize, on a     well-balanced set of criteria as input for the decision- making     process. We find criteria (or better: make implicit criteria of the     actors explicit) using the goal tree technique. If we introduce     alternatives in the goal tree, we basically create criteria for     specific alternatives. Later, in the decision-making process, these     alternatives would then be compared to each other on the full set of     criteria, including their 'own' criteria. As such, an alternative     will always have a good score on its own criteria, while other     alternatives will not, and substantial bias will have been     introduced in the analysis. To put it bluntly, an alternative that     involves building wind mills will never score well on 'more     photovoltaic cells'.</li> </ol> <p>If you do not recognize alternatives immediately, for all sub-goals ask yourself the question 'does this sub-goal lead to the higher goal, or, does it define the higher goal?' Alternatives will never have definition relations with higher goals, only causal relations. Useful goal trees only obtain definition relations and no causal relations</p> <ol> <li>Main goal too generic -- if you keep on asking the 'why do     you want this?' question, you end up with the general interest of     that particular actor. Car drivers want 'good mobility'. Presidents     want to stay in power; entrepreneurs want 'continuity' of their     business. These interests look like goals, but it is not practical     to use them as the main goal in a goal tree. These interests are     always there, also no problem is perceived and, thus, no     alternatives to solve it are considered. The interest turns into an     objective at the moment this interest is violated: then the actor     perceives a problem or a challenge and wants to solve it. At that     moment it becomes practical to translate the general interest into a     concrete goal for that particular perceived problem.</li> </ol> <p>That concrete main goal is not the same as the general interest, but represents the general interest for this particular problem. The president of an electricity producing company might consider his interest 'continuity of his company', independent of a problem. When society wants to be more environmentally friendly, and people are no longer buying his coal-generated electricity, he might translate his general interest to 'sustainable energy supply'. In his case, part of the definition of sustainable energy supply could be that there needs to be a market for</p> <p>His production. Should 'continuity' be the main goal, no practical well- balanced set of criteria could be found. In this case, continuity would be measured in, for instance, [year], but other too generic main goals might lead to a lot of criteria of which the majority have nothing to do with the perceived problem. Both ways, the criteria are not supporting the decision-making process.</p> <ol> <li>Goal tree too large -- if you do not limit yourself while making     the goal tree, you may end up with a goal tree that is too large to     read. It will then probably contain a very generic main goal, and a     number of branches that are not at all related to the problem field.     Try to use 3 to 4 levels in your goal tree, and not more than 20     goals.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"Process_System_Models/Solving_complex_problems/#system-description-causal-diagram","title":"System description (causal diagram)","text":"<p>A certain action will be an interesting alternative for a specific actor if it is 'doing something that solves his problem'. Now that the problems held by different actors are represented in criteria using the goal tree technique, an alternative becomes 'doing something that influences the scores on the criteria'. Basically, anything that influences the scores on the criteria can be treated as an alternative. Needless to say not all of these alternatives are practical, not even 'good' (i.e., influencing criteria in the desired direction of change). However, how 'good' certain alternatives are is a matter of interpreting their scores on the criteria. First step is to find out what influences the scores on the criteria</p> <p>Practically, let's take a criterion from our well-balanced set (derived from all the goal trees we made for the actors involved) and ask two questions: 'what factors influence this criterion?' and 'what factors are influenced by this criterion?' note that the questions we asked when constructing a goal tree were definition questions ('what does it mean?'), while these two questions are about causal relations ('what influences?').</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Of course, many other criteria matter as well, that is why we made the effort to create all these goal trees for all actors involved to come to a well-balanced set of criteria.

Its usefulness is that is shows how (i.e., through what mechanism) the alternatives eventually change the value of the criteria. It makes it possible to estimate the effects of different alternatives on the set of criteria that is used. Therefore, it makes it possible that a client, in the end, can compare the alternatives and choose one to solve the problem. In this way, the causal diagram, like all other techniques presented in this book, helps the client decide. In other words, it facilitates the decision-making process.</p> <p>What can help you practically when constructing a causal diagram is to identify factors using a table with three columns: 'concepts', 'factors' and 'units'. most of the time when you start studying a system, you have some abstract ideas about things that are important. If the problem is about alternative energy sources, you quickly might think about things like 'climate', 'electricity usage', or 'environmental awareness'.

The richest source of his ideas comes from the Dialogues, short dramas written by Socrates student and disciple, Plato. Although Plato wrote these masterful and enduring Dialogues years after Socrates death, most experts agree that at least the initial Dialogues (Euthyphro, The Apology, Crito) are faithful portrayals of Socrates ideas.</p> <p>\"The truth lies within each of us.\" By living an examined life, we can discover the principles of right thinking and action within us. In our effort to improve our souls and make them more godlike, we need only to apply the divine gift of reason to look deep within ourselves and discover immutable, universal truths. Of course, this process is aided tremendously by engaging in shared explorations with others through dialectical conversations. But the ultimate answers lie within us.

And conversely, our emotions have a dramatic influence on what we perceive and how we interpret it. And because our knowledge of the world begins with perceptions, values and emotions are a natural and inseparable part of this knowing process.</p> <p>Physiological feelings may accompany emotions, they are clearly not the same phenomenon. As Jaggar notes, feelings are episodic in the sense that they occur at a given moment in time, whereas emotions extend over time: For instance, we may assert truthfully that we are outraged by, proud of or saddened by certain events, even if at the moment we are neither agitated nor tearful. In addition, although people may be unaware of their emotional state angry, ambivalent, depressed they are (nearly) always aware of what they are feeling at any given moment in time. If emotions include but also transcend episodic feelings, what else are they? One perspective the cognitivist point of view sees emotions as involving intentional judgments as well as physiological sensations. So, for example, you may be feeling anxious or agitated but is the emotion involved related to concern about an upcoming exam or concern about an upcoming romantic date? In other words, an important component in emotions is the intentional judgment that is associated with the physiological feeling. We may conclude, for instance, that it is our (intentional) evaluation of an upcoming date that is responsible for the anxiety ( butterflies ) we are feeling. Yet as important as intentional judgments are for understanding the nature of emotions, we still have not fully accounted for the complex nature of emotional experience.</p> <p>In addition to immediate feelings and intentional judgments, emotions are also constituted by the social context in which they occur. For example, individuals in each culture are taught the appropriate emotional responses to people (strangers, authorities, religious figures, romantic interests) as well as situations (competitive sports, academic achievement, perceived insults). Each culture has its own unique emotional vocabulary that members of the culture learn at an early age, and this emotional vocabulary is an essential component in what emotions are all about. This vocabulary is expressed in the concepts and language of the culture, as well as in the actions and attitudes of the members. Jaggar s example of the emotion romantic love is pertinent here. Although there is general agreement regarding what this emotional concept means, each culture also tends to define the emotion and its affiliated attitudes and behavior in ways that are distinctive to that culture. The net result is that these social influences are integral elements in the construction of human emotions: hence the notion of emotions as social constructs.</p>"},{"location":"Process_System_Models/Thinking_critcal_about_profound_ideas/#is-there-a-spiritual-reality-religion","title":"Is there a spiritual reality - Religion","text":"<ul> <li> <p>A means to achieve ultimate spiritual transformation.

Spiritual enlightenment     can be achieved only by turning one's attention inward to     discover a transcendent reality from within. The bodily senses     are made for looking outward and are easily enticed by sensory     pleasures and worldly spectacles. But these sensations are     fleeting and impermanent, passing away when one dies, and     obscure the search for the infinite, everlasting reality. This     unseen but all-pervading reality they called Brahman, the     Unknowable.

But rebirth as a human being is     a precious and rare opportunity for the soul to advance toward     its ultimate goal of liberation from rebirth and merging with     the Brahman.</p> </li> <li> <p>Karma. Progress toward a merging with Brahman is the result     of karma, which refers to one's actions as well as the     consequences of one's actions. The ultimate goal of creating     ourselves through good choices is to escape from the karmic     wheel of birth, death, and rebirth, which is called samsara.

The I     is really a perpetually transient bundle of fleeting sensations,     impressions, ideas, and feelings. The metaphor often used for     the Buddhist concept of the self is that of a flame being passed     from candle to candle in continual movement.</p> </li> <li> <p>Suffering originates in our desires. Desires are wishes for     things to be different than they are. We wish for good health,     riches and fame, eternal life, perpetual happiness, permanence     and security, and many other things as well. But none of these     wishes can be achieved in a permanent fashion because life and     the universe are essentially impermanent. And because our wishes     are continually thwarted and events in the world are beyond our     control, frustration and suffering are unavoidable.</p> </li> <li> <p>Suffering will cease if all desires cease. This can be     achieved only by realizing and accepting the fact that there is     no unique, separate, permanent, immortal self.

This     process typically extends over multiple lifetimes, as we are     caught in the perpetual cycle of death and rebirth. Once again,     the self is not a permanent, immortal entity but is akin to a     flame being passed from moment to moment, lifetime to lifetime.

For the Daoist, time is cyclical, not linear as in Western thinking. The entire cosmos is a manifestation of an impersonal self-generating energy called qi (ch i). This force has two aspects whose interplay causes the ever-changing phenomena of the universe. Yin is the dark, receptive, female aspect; Yang is the bright, assertive, male aspect. The Yin is considered to be the breath that formed Earth, whereas the Yang is the breath that formed the heavens. These two forces symbolize the pairs of opposites that are seen throughout the universe, such as good and evil, light and dark, male and female. Wisdom lies in recognizing the ever-shifting, but regular and balanced, patterns of movement of Yin and Yang and moving along with them. The Dao is this creative rhythm of the universe. Daoists follow the art of wu-wei, which is to let nature take its course, rather than trying to impede it. To take a metaphor from the natural world, one should allow a river to flow toward the sea unimpeded, instead of erecting a dam that would interfere with its natural flow. Analogously, we should be like flowing water ourselves, bypassing and gently wearing away obstacles rather than aggressively attacking them, effortlessly moving through life without struggling, leaving all accomplishment behind without trying to hold on to them.</p> <p>Even when difficulties arise, the Daoist does not panic and take unnecessary action.

Jesus is also viewed as a prophet, but Muslims believe that his message was corrupted by followers who insisted on his divinity.

Regular prayer also keeps a Muslim s life in proper     perspective, a reminder to submit to God s will as rightfully     sovereign over his or her life.

To let go of this compulsion requires an act of will, a leap of faith in God s reality. And when we truly let go of our rational efforts, our faith is rewarded by our experiencing the reality of God s existence in nonrational or supra- rational ways. We can again see the analogy with nurturing a loving relationship: We need to let go of our need to analyze every dimension of the relationship for the authentic emotions to be released and suffuse our shared experiences.</p>"},{"location":"Process_System_Models/Thinking_critcal_about_profound_ideas/#ethics","title":"ETHICS","text":"<p>The study of ethics is derived from the ancient Greek word ethos, which refers to moral purpose or character as in a person of upstanding character. Ethos is also associated with the idea of cultural customs or habits. In addition, the etymology of the word moral can be traced back to the Latin word moralis, which also means custom. Thus the origins of these key concepts reflect both the private and the public nature of the moral life: We strive to become morally enlightened people, but we do so within the social context of cultural customs.</p> <p>In philosophy, one of the most important value domains includes your moral values, those personal qualities and rules of conduct that distinguish a person (and group of people) of upstanding character.</p> <p>But most people in our culture today have not been exposed to these teachings in depth. They have not challenged themselves to think deeply about ethical concepts, nor have they been guided to develop coherent, well- grounded ethical systems of their own. In many cases people attempt to navigate their passage through the turbulent and treacherous waters of contemporary life without an accurate moral compass, relying instead on a tangled m\u00e9lange of childhood teachings, popular wisdom, and unreliable intuitions. These homegrown and unreflective ethical systems are simply not up to the task of sorting out the moral complexities in our bewildering and fast-paced world, contributing to the moral crisis.</p> <p>Which of your moral values are clearly articulated and well-grounded?</p> <p>Which are ill-defined and tenuously rooted?</p> <p>Do your values form a coherent whole, consistent with one another, or do you detect fragmentation and inconsistency?</p> <p>The fatal flaw of ethical subjectivism is that it does not entail tolerance for the views or interests of others. It simply invests each individual with the moral authority to determine what is morally right and wrong, even if this means violating the rights or interests of others.</p> <p>Gandhi:</p> <p>The golden rule of conduct, therefore, is mutual tolerance, seeing that we will never all think alike and we shall see Truth in fragments and from different angles of vision. Conscience is not the same thing for all. Whilst there, it is a good guide for individual conduct, imposition of that conduct upon all will be an insufferable interference with everybody s freedom of conscience.</p> <p>The popular statement \"Everyone is entitled to his or her own belief \" suggests that no individual person has the right to say to another, \"Your belief is wrong you should believe this instead.\" In fact, it's often considered bad manners to question the beliefs of others and to suggest that their beliefs are confused, unfounded, illogical, or outright wrong. This approach seems to be tolerant and democratic, and it often works well for matters of taste. It doesn't make sense for you to say to someone else, You are wrong to wear your hair in a mullet, sport a tattoo, and eat chunky peanut butter directly from the jar. You might reasonably say, That's not my style, or I prefer a different look, but not that a person with different tastes is wrong.</p> <p>But moral beliefs are very, very different. If someone says, I agree with Hitler there is only one super-race, and all others are inferior, it does make sense to disagree and say, I think your belief is unethical and wrong. On what rationale do you base it? Similarly, if someone says, I think that the sexual abuse of children is all right, that person is not simply stating a personal belief: The individual is enunciating a general moral value that he or she believes applies to everyone. That s the unique logic of moral beliefs: When I say that something is right or wrong, I am by definition suggesting that it is right or wrong not just for me but for everyone.</p> <p>Moral beliefs implicate and influence our relationships with others in a way that matters of taste never will. Because moral beliefs affect the treatment and well-being of others, they are held to a much higher standard of evaluation and justification than other types The point is that our moral beliefs, whether openly acknowledged or implicit, have real-world consequences.</p>"},{"location":"Process_System_Models/Thinking_critcal_about_profound_ideas/#ethical-egoism","title":"Ethical egoism","text":"<p>Ayn Rand</p> <p>The virtue of altruism that traditional ethical theories and religions recommend is actually a vice because it encourages people not to pursue their own self-interest as their top priority.</p> <p></p> <p>Again ethical egoism</p> <ul> <li> <p>Confusion 1: It is false to believe that selfishness means the same     thing as self-interest.</p> </li> <li> <p>Confusion 2: It is false to say that every action is done either     from self-interest or from other-regarding motives.</p> </li> <li> <p>Confusion 3: It is false to assume that a concern for one's own     welfare is incompatible with any genuine concern for the welfare of     others.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Do the gods love piety because it is pious, or is it pious because they love it? In other words, is a moral value good or right because God commands it to be so, or is the moral value good or right independently of God s commands (though it is presumably consistent with divine moral values)?</p>"},{"location":"Process_System_Models/Thinking_critcal_about_profound_ideas/#character-virtue-ethics","title":"Character: Virtue Ethics","text":"<p>For Aristotle and other believers in virtue ethics, it is the cultivation of a virtuous character that is the goal of ethics, to become a virtuous person. The assumption is that genuinely virtuous people will act in morally principled ways as a natural expression of their moral goodness. And these moral actions will in turn strengthen their virtuous nature.</p> <p>Aristotle points out that, though we desire pleasure, wealth, fame, and success, we desire them mainly because we hope that they will bring us happiness. Similarly, people often strive to achieve virtues such as honor and intellectual insight, though again the ultimate aim is to be happy.</p> <p>Doctrine of the Golden Mean, a moral philosophy that is based on the concepts of temperance (moderation), self-discipline, and balance (an approach analogous to the Middle Way practiced in Buddhism).</p> <p>Virtue then is a state of deliberate moral purpose consisting in a mean that is relative to ourselves, the mean being determined by reason, or as a prudent man would determine it.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"Process_System_Models/Thinking_critcal_about_profound_ideas/#existentialism_1","title":"Existentialism","text":"<p>For existentialism the questions are more along the lines of: How do I live my life authentically? How can I create myself to be a uniquely significant individual? How can I invest my life with meaning while existing in a universe that lacks ultimate meaning? How can I develop an approach to moral responsibility that is grounded in my absolute freedom of choice?</p> <p></p> <p>Once you have developed a clear understanding of your moral code, the struggle has just begun. Becoming a morally enlightened person a person of character and integrity requires not just an insightful moral compass but also the commitment to use the compass to navigate the way through the storms and shoals of your moral life. As a reflective critical thinker, you will be conscious of the choices you are making and the reasons you are making them, and you will learn from experience, refining your code of ethics and improving your moral choices through self-exploration. Achieving moral enlightenment is an ongoing process, but it is a struggle that cannot be avoided if you are to live a life of purpose and meaning, created by a self that is authentic and, as Aristotle would say, great-souled.</p>"}]}
