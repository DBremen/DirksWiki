We must be idealistic (and thus capable of imagining a better world). We must be realistic (and thus see things as they are). We must be pragmatic (and thus adopt effective measures for moving toward our ideals). Thinking, feeling and wanting It is important to recognize that the mind is composed of three functions: Thinking Feeling Desiring (or wanting) Wherever one of these functions is present, the other two are present as well. And these three functions are continually influencing and being influenced by one another. Our thinking influences our feelings and desires. Our feelings influence our thinking and desires. Our desires influence our thinking and feeling. We cannot immediately change our desires or feelings. It is only thinking that we have direct access to. It makes no sense for someone to order you to feel what you do not feel or to desire what you do not desire. We do not change feelings by substituting other feelings, or desires by substituting other desires. But someone can suggest that we consider a new way to think. We can role-play new thoughts, but not new emotions or desires. It is possible to reason within a point of view with which we do not agree. By rethinking our thinking, we may change our thinking. When our thinking changes, our feelings and desires will shift in accordance with our thinking. Changing negative feelings caused by irrational thinking Identify a feeling you have experienced that you suspect might be irrational (a feeling such as irritability, resentment, arrogance, or depression). What thinking would account for the feeling? There may be more than one possibility here. If so, figure out which possibility is most likely. Determine the extent to which the thinking is reasonable. Pay close attention to the reasons you give to justify the thinking. Is it possible that these are not your actual reasons? Can you think of any other motives you might have? Consider alternative interpretations of the situation. If you conclude that the feeling is irrational, express precisely why you think so. Construct thinking that would represent a rational response in the situation. Actively attack the irrational thinking with the thinking that is rational. Actively rehearse the thinking that represents a rational response. Changing irrational behavior grounded in irrational desires or motivations Identify the questionable behavior (behavior that is getting you in trouble, causing problems for you, or causing problems for someone else). Identify the precise thinking leading to that behavior. What is the thinking that is generating the motivation to act in this manner? Analyze the extent to which the thinking is justified, without leaving out any significant relevant information. If the thinking is irrational, develop thinking that would be reasonable in this situation. Actively attack the unreasonable thinking with reasonable thinking. A well-cultivated critical thinker... raises vital questions and problems, formulating them clearly and precisely; gathers and assesses relevant information, and effectively interprets it; comes to well-reasoned conclusions and solutions, testing them against relevant criteria and standards thinks open mindedly within alternative systems of thought, recognizing and assessing, as need be, their assumptions, implications, and practical consequences; and Communicates effectively with others in figuring out solutions to complex problems. Critical thinking is, in short, self-directed, self-disciplined, self-monitored, and self-corrective thinking. It presupposes assent to rigorous standards of excellence and mindful command of their use. It entails effective communication and problem-solving abilities. Critical thinking adds a second level of thinking to ordinary thinking. The second level analyzes and assesses our ordinary thinking. First-Order-Thinking: It is spontaneous and non-reflective. It contains insight, prejudice, truth and error, good and bad reasoning, all combined Second-Order-Thinking: Is first-order-thinking raised to the level of conscious realization (analyzed, addressed, and reconstructed) We can develop in such a way that we learn to see mistakes in our own thinking, as well as the thinking of others Or we can merely develop some proficiency in making our opponent\\'s thinking look bad. Typically, people see mistakes in other\\'s thinking without being able to credit the strengths in those opposing views. This kind of thinking fails to consider, in good faith, viewpoints that contradict its own viewpoint. It lacks fair-mindedness . Instead: Work to understand and appreciate the viewpoints of others. Be willing to listen to arguments you do not necessarily hold. Change your views when faced with better reasoning. Question your own purposes, evidence, conclusions, implications, and points of view with the same vigor that we question those of others. Fair-mindedness entails a consciousness of the need to treat all viewpoints alike, without reference to one\\'s own feelings or selfish interests, or the feelings or selfish interests of one\\'s friends, company, community, or nation. It implies adherence to intellectual standards (such as accuracy and sound logic), uninfluenced by one\\'s own advantage or the advantage of one\\'s group. Intellectual humility (opposite of intellectual arrogance) may be defined as having a consciousness of the limits of one\\'s knowledge, including a sensitivity to circumstances in which one\\'s native egocentrism is likely to function self-deceptively. This entails being aware of one\\'s biases, one\\'s prejudices, the limitations of one\\'s viewpoint, and the extent of one\\'s ignorance. Intellectual humility depends on recognizing that one should not claim more than one actually knows. It does not imply spinelessness or submissiveness. It implies the lack of intellectual pretentiousness, boastfulness, or conceit, combined with insight into the logical foundations, or lack of such foundations, of one\\'s beliefs. Intellectual courage may be defined as having a consciousness of the need to face and fairly address ideas, beliefs, or viewpoints toward which one has strong negative emotions and to which one has not given a serious hearing. Intellectual courage is connected to the recognition that ideas that society considers dangerous or absurd are sometimes rationally justified (in whole or in part). Conclusions and beliefs inculcated in people are sometimes false or misleading. To determine for oneself what makes sense, one must not passively and uncritically accept what one has learned. Intellectual courage comes into play here because there is some truth in some ideas considered dangerous and absurd, and distortion or falsity in some ideas strongly held by social groups to which we belong. People need courage to be fair-minded thinkers in these circumstances. The penalties for nonconformity can be severe. The Elements of Thought in Relationship Our purpose affects the manner in which we ask questions (What is our purpose?) All reasoning has a purpose. Take time to state your purpose clearly. Choose significant and realistic purposes. Distinguish your purpose from related purposes. Make sure your purpose is fair in context (that it doesn\\'t involve violating the rights of others). Check periodically to be sure you are still focused on your purpose and haven\\'t wandered from your target. The manner in which we ask questions affects the information we gather (What is the key question here?) All reasoning is an attempt to figure out something, to settle some question, solve some problem. Take time to clearly and precisely state the question at issue. Express the question in several ways to clarify its meaning and scope. Break the question into sub-questions (when you can). Identify the type of question you are dealing with (historical, economic, biological, etc.) and whether the question has one right answer, is a matter of mere opinion, or require reasoning from more than one point of view. Think through the complexities of the question (think deeply through the question). The information we gather affects the way we interpret it (What data do we need to make this decision?): All reasoning is based on data, information, and evidence. Restrict your claims to those supported by the data you have. Search for information that opposes your position as well as information that supports it. Make sure that all information used is clear, accurate, and relevant to the question at issue. Make sure you have gathered sufficient information. Make sure, especially, that you have considered all significant information relevant to the issue. The way we interpret information affects the way we conceptualize it (Is there another way to interpret these data?): All reasoning is expressed through, and shaped by, concepts and ideas. Clearly identify key concepts. Consider alternative concepts or alternative definitions for concepts. Make sure you are using concepts with care and precision. Use concepts justifiably (not distorting their established meanings). The way we conceptualize information affects the assumptions we make (Do we need to question that? What other points of view do we need to consider?): All reasoning is done from some point of view. Clearly identify your point of view. Seek other relevant points of view and identify their strengths as well as weaknesses. Strive to be fair-minded in evaluating all points of view. The assumptions we make affect the implications that follow from our thinking (What are we taking for granted here?): All reasoning is based on assumptions. Clearly identify your assumptions and determine whether they are justifiable. Consider how your assumptions are shaping your point of view. The implications that follow from our thinking affect the way we see things, our point of view: All reasoning contains inferences or interpretations by which we draw conclusions and give meaning to data. Infer only what the evidence implies. Check inferences for their consistency with each other. Identify assumptions that lead you to your inferences. Make sure your inferences logically follow from the information. All reasoning leads somewhere or has implications and consequences. Trace the logical implications and consequences that follow from your reasoning. Search for negative as well as positive implications. Consider all possible significant consequences. Assumptions vs. Inferences Behavior of critical thinkers When they read, they see the text as a verbal representation of the thinking of the author. They strive to enter the writer\\'s point of view. They strive to reconstruct the author\\'s thinking in their own mind. When they write, they think explicitly about the point of view of their intended audience. They use their insight into the thinking of the likely audience to present their thinking in the most accessible way. Their speaking reflects a parallel emphasis. They use the dialogue to find out specifically the point of view and concerns of those with whom they are talking. They do not try to force their ideas on others. They recognize that people must think their own way to ideas and beliefs. They, therefore, share experiences and information more than final conclusions. They listen attentively to the thinking of others. They ask more questions than they make assertions. Critical thinkers have a distinctive point of view concerning themselves. They see themselves as competent learners. They have a \\\"can do\\\" vision of their own learning. They do not see opposing points of view as a threat to their own beliefs. They see all beliefs as subject to change in the face of new evidence or better reasoning . They see themselves as lifelong learners. The Psychology of Intelligence Analysis: What people in general perceive, and how readily they perceive it, are strongly influenced by their past experience, education, cultural values, and role requirements, as well as by the stimuli recorded by their receptor organs. We tend to perceive what we expect (rather than what we want) to perceive Objectivity is achieved by making basic assumptions and reasoning as explicit as possible so that they can be challenged by others and analysts can, themselves, examine their validity. Mind-sets tend to be quick to form but resistant to change. New information is assimilated (combined/integrated) to existing images. The receipt of information in small increments over time also facilitates assimilation. Counter measures Encourage analysis that clearly outline their assumptions and chains of inference and that specify the degree and source of uncertainty involved in the conclusions. Support analyses that periodically re-examine key problems from the ground up in order to avoid the pitfalls of the incremental approach. Emphasize procedures (like brainstorming) that expose and elaborate alternative points of view. Wife and mother in-law 3 distinct memory processes: Sensory information storage SIS holds sensory images for several tenths of a second after they are received by the sensory organs. The functioning of SIS may be observed if you close your eyes, then open and close them again as rapidly as possible. As your eyes close, notice how the visual image is maintained for a fraction of a second before fading. It is not possible to consciously extend the time that sensory information is held in SIS. The function of SIS is to make it possible for the brain to work on processing a sensory event for longer than the duration of the event itself. Short-term memory Information passes from SIS into short-term memory, where it is held for only a few seconds or minutes. Whereas SIS holds the complete image, STM stores only the interpretation of the image. If a sentence is spoken, SIS retains the sounds, while STM holds the words formed by these sounds. Like SIS, short-term memory holds information temporarily, pending further processing. This processing includes judgments concerning meaning, relevance, and significance, as well as the mental actions necessary to integrate selected portions of the information into long-term memory. When a person forgets immediately the name of someone to whom he or she has just been introduced, it is because the name was not transferred from short-term to long-term memory. A central characteristic of STM is the severe limitation on its capacity. A person who is asked to listen to and repeat a series of 10 or 20 names or numbers normally retains only five or six items. Commonly it is the last five or six. If one focuses instead on the first items, STM becomes saturated by this effort, and the person cannot concentrate on and recall the last items. People make a choice where to focus their attention. They can concentrate on remembering or interpreting or taking notes on information received moments ago, or pay attention to information currently being received. Limitations on the capacity of short-term memory often preclude doing both. Retrieval of information from STM is direct and immediate because the information has never left the conscious mind. Information can be maintained in STM indefinitely by a process of \"rehearsal\"---repeating it over and over again. But while rehearsing some items to retain them in STM, people cannot simultaneously add new items. The severe limitation on the amount of information retainable in STM at any one time is physiological, and there is no way to overcome it. Long-term memory Some information retained in STM is processed into long-term memory. This information on past experiences is filed away in the recesses of the mind and must be retrieved before it can be used. In contrast to the immediate recall of current experience from STM, retrieval of information from LTM is indirect and sometimes laborious. Loss of detail as sensory stimuli are interpreted and passed from SIS into STM and then into LTM is the basis for the phenomenon of selective perception discussed in the previous chapter. It imposes limits on subsequent stages of analysis, inasmuch as the lost data can never be retrieved. People can never take their mind back to what was actually there in sensory information storage or short-term memory. They can only retrieve their interpretation of what they thought was there as stored in LTM. Organization of Information in memory The three memory processes comprise the storehouse of information or database that we call memory, but the total memory system must include other features as well. Some mental process must determine what information is passed from SIS into STM and from STM into LTM; decide how to search the LTM data base and judge whether further memory search is likely to be productive; assess the relevance of retrieved information; and evaluate potentially contradictory data. To explain the operation of the total memory system, psychologists posit the existence of an interpretive mechanism that operates on the data base and a monitor or central control mechanism that guides and oversees the operation of the whole system. Little is known of these mechanisms and how they relate to other mental processes. Physically, the brain consists of roughly 10 billion neurons, each analogous to a computer chip capable of storing information. Each neuron has octopus-like arms called axons and dendrites. Electrical impulses flow through these arms and are ferried by neurotransmitting chemicals across what is called the synaptic gap between neurons. Memories are stored as patterns of connections between neurons. When two neurons are activated, the connections or \"synapses\" between them are strengthened. As you read this chapter, the experience actually causes physical changes in your brain. \"In a matter of seconds, new circuits are formed that can change forever the way you think about the world.\" Memory records a lifetime of experience and thoughts. Such a massive data retrieval mechanism, like a library or computer system, must have an organizational structure; otherwise information that enters the system could never be retrieved. Imagine the Library of Congress if there were no indexing system. Imagine memory as a massive, multidimensional spider web. This image captures what is, perhaps the most important property of information stored in memory---its interconnectedness. One thought leads to another. It is possible to start at any one point in memory and follow a perhaps labyrinthine path to reach any other point. Information is retrieved by tracing through the network of interconnections to the place where it is stored. Retrievability is influenced by the number of locations in which information is stored and the number and strength of pathways from this information to other concepts that might be activated by incoming information . The more frequently a path is followed, the stronger that path becomes and the more readily available the information located along that path. If one has not thought of a subject for some time, it may be difficult to recall details. After thinking our way back into the appropriate context and finding the general location in our memory, the interconnections become more readily available. We begin to remember names, places, and events that had seemed to be forgotten. Once people have started thinking about a problem one way, the same mental circuits or pathways get activated and strengthened each time they think about it. This facilitates the retrieval of information. These same pathways, however, also become the mental ruts that make it difficult to reorganize the information mentally so as to see it from a different perspective. One useful concept of memory organization is what some cognitive psychologists call a \"schema.\" A schema is any pattern of relationships among data stored in memory. It is any set of nodes and links between them in the spider web of memory that hang together so strongly that they can be retrieved and used more or less as a single unit. Getting Information Into and Out of Long-Term Memory The key factor in transferring information from short-term to long-term memory is the development of associations between the new information and schemata already available in memory . This, in turn, depends upon two variables: the extent to which the information to be learned relates to an already existing schema, and the level of processing given to the new information. Depth (level) of processing refers to the amount of effort and cognitive capacity employed to process information, and the number and strength of associations that are thereby forged between the data to be learned and knowledge already in memory. The following illustrative tasks are listed in order of the depth of mental processing required: Say how many letters there are in each word on the list Give a word that rhymes with each word Make a mental image of each word, make up a story that incorporates each word. Memory Rarely Changes Retroactively. Memories are seldom reassessed or reorganized retroactively in response to new information. For example, information that is dismissed as unimportant or irrelevant because it did not fit an analyst's expectations does not become more memorable even if the analyst changes his or her thinking to the point where the same information, received today, would be recognized as very significant. Multiattribute Utility Analysis (WeightingFactors_WeightedAverage.xlsx) Pairwise Comparison (PairedComparison_Analysis.xlsx) Step-by-Step Outline of Analysis of Competing Hypotheses Identify the possible hypotheses to be considered. Use a group of analysts with different perspectives to brainstorm the possibilities. Make a list of significant evidence and arguments for and against each hypothesis. Prepare a matrix with hypotheses across the top and evidence down the side. Analyze the \"diagnosticity\" of the evidence and arguments that is, identify which items are most helpful in judging the relative likelihood of the hypotheses. Refine the matrix. Reconsider the hypotheses and delete evidence and arguments that have no diagnostic value. Draw tentative conclusions about the relative likelihood of each hypothesis. Proceed by trying to disprove the hypotheses rather than prove them. Analyze how sensitive your conclusion is to a few critical items of evidence. Consider the consequences for your analysis if that evidence were wrong, misleading, or subject to a different interpretation. Report conclusions. Discuss the relative likelihood of all the hypotheses, not just the most likely one. Identify milestones for future observation that may indicate events are taking a different course than expected. De Bono`s thinking course PMI (Plus Minus Interesting) The PMI is an attention directing tool. Direct your attention to plus, minus and interesting points about a subject in order one after the other over a period of 2-3 minutes. Rather than to focus on defending one`s prejudged opinion by collecting pro`s and con`s.(Reacting and justifying your reaction) Instead of intelligence being used to prejudice the matter decision can be made afterwards. Emotions are now applied after the exploration phase. In PMI we are not looking to assign values to the points. We look in one direction after the other (scanning) and note down what we see (church in the north and in the south) You can ask a person to do a PMI when there seems to be prejudged reaction to a situation Practice questions: Should everyone wear a badge showing his or her mood? Should every child adopt an older person to look after? Should everyone be allowed to indicate where they would like their taxes spent on? Example Subject: All cars should be painted yellow P: Easier to see on the road and at night No problem in deciding what color you wanted No waiting for the color you wanted Easier to manufacture cars M: Boring Difficult to find your car Easier to steal cars Car chases more difficult for police Restriction of freedom to pick I: Interesting to see if different shades of yellow would arose Interesting to see if people would appreciate the safety factor Interesting to see whether peoples attitude towards cars would change Interesting to see whether the idea would be enforceable APC (alternatives, choices, possibilities) Encourage to find additional alternative ways even once a seemingly good solution has been found. The brain is a pattern matching machine The mind works to make sense of confusion and uncertainty. It works to recognize familiar patterns, once such a pattern is recognized the mind switches into it and follows it along (further thinking is unnecessary). It works somewhat similar to driving a car. As soon as you hit a familiar road you can stop using the map/asking for directions . Our thinking continuously searches for those familiar roads that make thinking unnecessary. Once a pattern has been formed the mind no longer has to analyze or sort information. All that is required is enough information to trigger the pattern. The mind then follows along the pattern automatically in the same way as a driver follows a familiar road. Unless there are competing patterns then anything remotely similar to the established pattern will be treated as if it were that pattern. How the mind works as an information processing system Perception is the way we look at things. Processing is what we do with that perception. The mind is an active Information system The first arriving ball (information) alters the surface. The altered surface then affects the way in which further balls (information) is received. Incoming information organizes itself into patterns. The purpose of perception is to allow patterns to form and then to use them. In perception the mind works as a self-organizing information system (active) which allows incoming experience to organize itself into patterns. We need to be aware that we may often lock into the wrong pattern though. The mechanisms for pattern changing within our mind are mistake, accident and humour. In a self-maximizing system with a memory the arrangement of information must always be less than the best possible arrangement. A pattern may persist because it is useful and adequate and yet a restructuring of the pattern could give rise to something very much better. Sequence in which the information arrives determines the pattern: Lateral thinking \"The vertical thinker says: 'I know what lam looking for.' The lateral thinker says: 'I am looking but I won't know what I am looking for until I have found it.'\" Lateral thinking is both an attitude of mind and also a number of defined methods. The attitude of mind involves the willingness to try to look at things in different ways. It involves an appreciation that any way of looking at things is only one amongst many possible ways. It involves an understanding of how the mind uses patterns and the need to escape from an established pattern to switch into a better one. Vertical thinking is analytical, lateral thinking is provocative Lateral thinking has to do with change, especially when change involves escaping from a pattern that has been satisfactory in the past. The usual method of change is through criticism and attack. The weakness of that method is that we can only consider change when a concept can be shown to be inadequate and when the attacking party has the power to carry through the change. It may be necessary to be on the top of a mountain in order to find the best way up. With vertical thinking one has to be correct at every step, with lateral thinking one does not have to be Hindsight and insight : We switch to a new pattern and suddenly see that something is reasonable and obvious. In hindsight any creative idea must be logical -- otherwise we could never accept it as having a value. The mistake we make is to assume that since it is logical in hindsight then the better exercise of logic could have got us there in the first place. Lateral thinking seeks to achieve the pattern-switching that occurs in insight. Creative hit list This is a formal target list of focuses that need creative thinking. The list would be available on bulletin boards or a website. The Creative Hit List provides a target and a demand. You are expected to have ideas about the items on the list. You may even be specifically asked to have an idea on a particular item by a particular date. A team may be assigned a task from the list and asked to report back on a given date. The list may be changed but some items may be more permanent. There should be about 10 items on the list. The List provides a permanent background demand that emphasizes that creativity is always needed. Concepts You can identify the concept that seems to be in use and then seek to find other ways of delivering the same concept. There can be operational or functional concepts. These describe the way something is done. There can be value concepts. Why this is of value. There can be purpose concepts. Why we are doing this. There can be descriptive concepts covering a whole range of things that seem to have something in common. Concept extraction: We seek to develop alternatives and new ideas by \\'extracting the concept\\' and then looking around for other ways to deliver this concept by means of a specific idea. Take a piece of paper and a pen. You start with the defined purpose of what you are trying to achieve at the right-hand side of the page. For example, you might set out \\'traffic congestion in cities\\'. The implied purpose is how to deal with the problem of traffic congestion in cities. In your diagram, everything will need to flow or cascade from this point on the paper. The next level lays out the broad concepts, or \\'thinking directions\\', which might help tackle the problem. These might be: reduce traffic improve traffic flow increase travel space. We then move backwards (towards the right-hand side of the page) to list the more specific concepts that could operate the broad concepts. 1.1 For \\'reducing traffic\\' we might have: restrict the number of vehicles; discourage traffic; reduce the need to travel; multi-user vehicles. 2.1 For \\'improving traffic flow\\' we might have: deal with peak travel We then take each of the specific concepts and see how this could be put into action with specific ideas. 1.1.1 For \\'restricting the number of vehicles\\' we might have: high entry tolls; vehicle purchase permission auction (as in Singapore); special city access licenses. 1.1.2 For \\'discouraging traffic\\' we might have: high congestion charges for entering the city (as in London); no provision for parking; poor-quality Stepping stone Movement is for moving across channels. We use judgment for staying within existing channels but are also able to use movement when we want to change patterns. In the judgment idiom, when we come to an idea which is wrong we dismiss it and back away. In the movement idiom we use the idea as a stepping stone to help us move to a different pattern. It means using the idea to see where it leads to. It is not that we treat a bad idea as a good idea. When one Jumps right to the solution then the soundness of that solution obviously cannot depend on the soundness of the path by which it was reached. Nevertheless the solution may still make sense in its own right without having to depend on the pathway by which it was reached. Po provocation operation Self-organizing systems tend to settle down in a stable equilibrium, which is called a local equilibrium. They remain in that state until provocation moves them towards a more global equilibrium. What is important is that the provocation is meant to be a provocation. It is never meant to be an idea in itself. It is never meant to be just a desire for improvement. \"There may not be a reason for saying something until after it has been said\" Movement is obtained in a variety of ways: Extracting the principle of an idea Following the moment-to-moment consequences Focusing on the difference from the usual Spelling out the positive aspects You can extract a concept and then work with this. You can focus on the difference between the provocation and the usual situation. You can pick out the positive aspects and work with these. You can imagine the provocation put into action and see what happens. Escape Focus on things we take for granted and wonder whether they are indeed the only or best way of doing things. E.g. A restaurant without chairs It is difficult to identify those things we take for granted. To obtain those we can try: Dropping a feature Altering a feature Finding an alternative way of achieving the same end Reversal Here we take a normal relationship and reverse it. Filters are there to remove some of the tar in cigarettes. \\'Po, we add something instead of removing it.\\' Distortion Here there is a change in a sequence or a change in relationships. Normally, you pick up the phone, dial the number and speak. \\'Po, you speak before you dial.\\' This can lead to two ideas. The first is voice-activated dialing -- which exists. The second idea is to build a simple tape recorder into the phone. Exaggeration This is an exaggeration, upwards or downwards of any dimension. Po, telephone calls can only last two minutes.\\' This suggests a compression technique so that you can talk at a normal speed, but the transmitted message is compressed so as to occupy less of the line time. The exaggeration must be unreasonable otherwise it has little provocative effect. Wishful thinking The provocation is in the form of \\'wouldn\\'t it be nice if . . .\\'. The provocation must be more than just a desire. It would not be very provocative to say \\'Po, the trains were always on time\\'. But it would be provocative to say \\'Po, you got paid for waiting for a train\\'. Random stimulation method: A random input (word, picture. We may also extract a function from the word (e.g. elephant very large) serves to tap into lines of thought that might otherwise have been hidden. In our thinking we move out of a certain area along the traditional route. If we toss in a random word it has its own associations. Sooner or later these link up with the associations of the problem we are trying to solve. Information and thinking It is only our lack of complete information that makes it necessary for us to think. The more information we have the better will our thinking be and the more appropriate our actions. There are several areas where we can never have complete information one of those is the future. Information is no substitute for thinking and vice versa. CAF Consider All Factors Think about all factors related to the problem. The emphasis is on \"What has been left out?\" and \"What else should be consider?\" C & S Consider the consequences of an action or decision. Timeframes below can be adjusted to suit the problem at hand. The different time zones are focused upon on turn (like for PMI) Immediate consequences \\< 1 year Short-term 1-5 years Medium-term 5-20 years Long-term >20 years Dense reading and dense listening Good listener: Listens slowly Does not jump ahead nor does he rush to judge or already formulate his own reply Focusses on what is being said Listens to the words between the words Good reading is like good listening, reading between the lines and wondering why something has been expressed in a particular way. Questions Ask the right questions. Shooting questions (focused questions where we know what we are aiming at and Fishing questions (more open questions)) Negative information is important. In some cases negative information can help to exclude a whole range of possibilities. Fi-Fo Survey of info that is already available and that which is still required. Information In: The info already available is examined carefully. All the implications and logical inferences are extracted from it. Information Out: The gaps in the information are examined, defined and spelled out. Thinking methodology Clash system Western civilization has developed the clash system in which two opposing views fight it out. This covers argument, debate. The method is used in politics, courts, business decisions and other day to day living areas. Disadvantages of the clash system: As one side attacks and the other defends each point of view grows more rigid One or the other point will eventually prevail The other group is bitter and unwilling to make the new system work In order to change something an existing idea must be attacked and shown to be inadequate Eclectics Seeks to pull out of the situation what is of value -- no matter on which side it is to be found. There are no opposing ideas to begin with. There is joint listening and joint exploration. It is only later that ideas start to emerge. We accept possibilities lay them out in parallel and then seek to design forwards. EBS Examine both sides What is really the other point of view? The exploration is neutral. Participants are encouraged to explore both sides in such a way that from listening to their points you would be unable to tell which point view they actually favor. Doing an EBS does not exclude the holding of a point of view, but this comes after the exploration not before it. ADI Agreement, Disagreement Irrelevance The two sides are compared (from EBS) and the areas of agreement are noted. Next the areas of disagreement are noted and finally the areas of irrelevance. In a difficult situation it might be better if for each party strongly holding an opinion to do an ADI on its own. It often turns out that this neutral exploration shows that the areas of disagreement might be quite small compared to how large they appear in the argument situation. Isolation the area of disagreement means that it can be further examined in order to find out how basic the disagreement might be. Logic bubble A logic bubble is that bubble of perception within which a person is acting. The bubble includes perception of circumstances, structure, context and relationship. In any situation it is useful to map out the logic bubbles of the other people involved. OPV other people`s view In using the tool the thinker tries to put himself in the other person`s shoes in order to look at the world from that position. This involves the identification of the other people involved in a situation. Doing an OPV does not mean putting into the mouths of all parties sane and rational arguments of the sort one might hold oneself. Nor does it mean putting into their mouths complaints and irrationality in order to condemn their point of view. It means trying to look objectively at the world from the other points of view. Thinking and/vs. emotions/gut feeling Three possible ways in which thinking/perception can interact with emotions. Blind emotion: Emotion is present from the beginning even before the particular situation is encountered. This may happen with jealousy, hatred or aggression. With our perception we examine the situation briefly. We recognize some pattern and that switches on our emotion. From then on our further perception is narrowed and channeled by that emotion. Broad and calm exploration of the situation and in the end emotions come in to make the final decision and choose the course of action. Values are the links between events and our emotions they convert events into matters about which we feel strongly. HV and LV High values and low values Divide the values occurring in a situation into high and low values. High values are the one that determine action and the low values are the ones which have to be taken into account. The examination of values is an awareness exercise. It is a matter of becoming aware of the values that are inherent in a situation the conflict of values as they are perceived by the people involved and the source of these values. Pull out the value laden words from a written or verbal conversation. Six thinking hats Parallel thinking Imagine a rather ornate building of a square shape. There are four people, each of whom is facing one aspect of this building. Through a mobile phone or walkie-talkie, each person is insisting and arguing that he or she is facing the most beautiful aspect of the building. Parallel thinking means that they change how they go about this argument. All four people move around to the south side of the building together. Then all of them move on to the west side. Then the north and finally the east side. So all of them, in parallel, are looking at the same side of the building at any one moment. Instead of argument, where A is adversarially attacking B, we have a system where A and B are both looking and thinking in the same direction -- but the directions change as they move around. That is parallel thinking. Method: There is no fixed order of use. You can choose the sequence you want. In training, some of the more useful sequences will be suggested. Blue Hat This is the organizing or control hat. It is rather like the conductor of an orchestra. It is used right at the beginning of a discussion to decide the focus and what sequence of hats to use. During the meeting the chairperson or facilitator metaphorically wears the Blue Hat in a disciplinary way. People are reminded of the hat in use if they stray from that mode. The Blue Hat is used at the end for the outcome, summary and next steps. White Hat Think of white and paper and printout. The White Hat is concerned with information. What information do we have? What information is missing? What information do we need -- and how are we going to get it? Questions can be asked under the White Hat. If conflicting information is put forward, there is no argument. Both versions are put down in parallel and then discussed when that information needs to be used. Red Hat Think of red and fire and warmth. The Red Hat is to do with feelings, emotions, intuition. Under the Red Hat all participants are invited to put forward their feelings. In a normal discussion you can only put forward these things if they are disguised as logic. Here there is no need to justify or explain them. They exist and can therefore be put forward. The Red Hat period is very brief and simply allows these things to be put forward. Black Hat Think of the black of a judge\\'s robes. The Black Hat is for critical thinking. What is wrong with the idea? What are its weaknesses? The Black Hat looks at the down side, why something will not work, the risks and dangers. All the negative comments that might be made during a meeting are concentrated under the Black Hat. The Black Hat is very useful, possibly the most useful of all the hats, but it has its defined place. Yellow Hat Think of sunshine and optimism, dawn and a new day. This focuses on the positive. What are the benefits? The values? How could it be done? Education is mostly about critical thinking. We never really develop \\'value sensitivity\\'. This means the ability to find value in anything -- even things we do not like and will not use. Nevertheless we should, honestly and objectively, find value in such things. Without value sensitivity, creativity can be a waste of time. I have sat in on meetings where good ideas have been generated but no one has been able to see the value of the ideas. Green Hat Think of vegetation, growth and branches. This is directly concerned with creativity. When the Green Hat is in use, participants are expected to make a creative effort or keep quiet. They do not like keeping quiet so they make that effort. This means looking for new ideas. It means considering alternatives, both the obvious ones and new ones. It means generating possibilities. It means modifying and changing a suggested idea, possibly through the deliberate use of lateral thinking tools. De Bono: The Six Value Medals In a way, a perception is an unconscious about how we see the world around us. Because they are unconscious we have no control over our perceptions unless we make the driving values visible. Logic can help you to decide how to do something but logic cannot tell you what you want to do. The difficulty is that any decision made on a value basis can always be \"rationalized\" in hindsight as being made on a purely logical basis. We can seek to rationalize a bad decision made purely on an emotional basis. If we are good at rationalizing we may not realize just how bad the decision really is. If we come to believe that our decisions are entirely logical, the greater danger is that we then neglect to pay attention to our values and may not even realize how they affect our decisions. Values are the underlying drivers that bring about our emotions.","title":"DeBono Thinking critical critical thinking"},{"location":"General/DeBono_Thinking_critical_critical_thinking/#thinking-feeling-and-wanting","text":"It is important to recognize that the mind is composed of three functions: Thinking Feeling Desiring (or wanting) Wherever one of these functions is present, the other two are present as well.

Our desires influence our thinking and feeling. We cannot immediately change our desires or feelings. It is only thinking that we have direct access to.

Critical thinking is, in short, self-directed, self-disciplined, self-monitored, and self-corrective thinking. It presupposes assent to rigorous standards of excellence and mindful command of their use. It entails effective communication and problem-solving abilities. Critical thinking adds a second level of thinking to ordinary thinking. The second level analyzes and assesses our ordinary thinking. First-Order-Thinking: It is spontaneous and non-reflective. It contains insight, prejudice, truth and error, good and bad reasoning, all combined Second-Order-Thinking: Is first-order-thinking raised to the level of conscious realization (analyzed, addressed, and reconstructed) We can develop in such a way that we learn to see mistakes in our own thinking, as well as the thinking of others Or we can merely develop some proficiency in making our opponent\\'s thinking look bad. Typically, people see mistakes in other\\'s thinking without being able to credit the strengths in those opposing views. This kind of thinking fails to consider, in good faith, viewpoints that contradict its own viewpoint. It lacks fair-mindedness . Instead: Work to understand and appreciate the viewpoints of others. Be willing to listen to arguments you do not necessarily hold. Change your views when faced with better reasoning. Question your own purposes, evidence, conclusions, implications, and points of view with the same vigor that we question those of others. Fair-mindedness entails a consciousness of the need to treat all viewpoints alike, without reference to one\\'s own feelings or selfish interests, or the feelings or selfish interests of one\\'s friends, company, community, or nation. It implies adherence to intellectual standards (such as accuracy and sound logic), uninfluenced by one\\'s own advantage or the advantage of one\\'s group.

Intellectual courage may be defined as having a consciousness of the need to face and fairly address ideas, beliefs, or viewpoints toward which one has strong negative emotions and to which one has not given a serious hearing. Intellectual courage is connected to the recognition that ideas that society considers dangerous or absurd are sometimes rationally justified (in whole or in part). Conclusions and beliefs inculcated in people are sometimes false or misleading. To determine for oneself what makes sense, one must not passively and uncritically accept what one has learned. Intellectual courage comes into play here because there is some truth in some ideas considered dangerous and absurd, and distortion or falsity in some ideas strongly held by social groups to which we belong. People need courage to be fair-minded thinkers in these circumstances. The penalties for nonconformity can be severe.","title":"A well-cultivated critical thinker..."},{"location":"General/DeBono_Thinking_critical_critical_thinking/#the-elements-of-thought-in-relationship","text":"","title":"The Elements of Thought in Relationship"},{"location":"General/DeBono_Thinking_critical_critical_thinking/#our-purpose-affects-the-manner-in-which-we-ask-questions-what-is-our-purpose","text":"All reasoning has a purpose.

Whereas SIS holds the complete image, STM stores only the interpretation of the image. If a sentence is spoken, SIS retains the sounds, while STM holds the words formed by these sounds. Like SIS, short-term memory holds information temporarily, pending further processing. This processing includes judgments concerning meaning, relevance, and significance, as well as the mental actions necessary to integrate selected portions of the information into long-term memory. When a person forgets immediately the name of someone to whom he or she has just been introduced, it is because the name was not transferred from short-term to long-term memory. A central characteristic of STM is the severe limitation on its capacity. A person who is asked to listen to and repeat a series of 10 or 20 names or numbers normally retains only five or six items. Commonly it is the last five or six. If one focuses instead on the first items, STM becomes saturated by this effort, and the person cannot concentrate on and recall the last items. People make a choice where to focus their attention. They can concentrate on remembering or interpreting or taking notes on information received moments ago, or pay attention to information currently being received. Limitations on the capacity of short-term memory often preclude doing both. Retrieval of information from STM is direct and immediate because the information has never left the conscious mind. Information can be maintained in STM indefinitely by a process of \"rehearsal\"---repeating it over and over again. But while rehearsing some items to retain them in STM, people cannot simultaneously add new items. The severe limitation on the amount of information retainable in STM at any one time is physiological, and there is no way to overcome it.","title":"Short-term memory"},{"location":"General/DeBono_Thinking_critical_critical_thinking/#long-term-memory","text":"Some information retained in STM is processed into long-term memory. This information on past experiences is filed away in the recesses of the mind and must be retrieved before it can be used. In contrast to the immediate recall of current experience from STM, retrieval of information from LTM is indirect and sometimes laborious. Loss of detail as sensory stimuli are interpreted and passed from SIS into STM and then into LTM is the basis for the phenomenon of selective perception discussed in the previous chapter. It imposes limits on subsequent stages of analysis, inasmuch as the lost data can never be retrieved. People can never take their mind back to what was actually there in sensory information storage or short-term memory. They can only retrieve their interpretation of what they thought was there as stored in LTM.","title":"Long-term memory"},{"location":"General/DeBono_Thinking_critical_critical_thinking/#organization-of-information-in-memory","text":"The three memory processes comprise the storehouse of information or database that we call memory, but the total memory system must include other features as well. Some mental process must determine what information is passed from SIS into STM and from STM into LTM; decide how to search the LTM data base and judge whether further memory search is likely to be productive; assess the relevance of retrieved information; and evaluate potentially contradictory data. To explain the operation of the total memory system, psychologists posit the existence of an interpretive mechanism that operates on the data base and a monitor or central control mechanism that guides and oversees the operation of the whole system. Little is known of these mechanisms and how they relate to other mental processes. Physically, the brain consists of roughly 10 billion neurons, each analogous to a computer chip capable of storing information. Each neuron has octopus-like arms called axons and dendrites. Electrical impulses flow through these arms and are ferried by neurotransmitting chemicals across what is called the synaptic gap between neurons. Memories are stored as patterns of connections between neurons. When two neurons are activated, the connections or \"synapses\" between them are strengthened. As you read this chapter, the experience actually causes physical changes in your brain. \"In a matter of seconds, new circuits are formed that can change forever the way you think about the world.\" Memory records a lifetime of experience and thoughts. Such a massive data retrieval mechanism, like a library or computer system, must have an organizational structure; otherwise information that enters the system could never be retrieved. Imagine the Library of Congress if there were no indexing system. Imagine memory as a massive, multidimensional spider web. This image captures what is, perhaps the most important property of information stored in memory---its interconnectedness. One thought leads to another. It is possible to start at any one point in memory and follow a perhaps labyrinthine path to reach any other point. Information is retrieved by tracing through the network of interconnections to the place where it is stored. Retrievability is influenced by the number of locations in which information is stored and the number and strength of pathways from this information to other concepts that might be activated by incoming information . The more frequently a path is followed, the stronger that path becomes and the more readily available the information located along that path. If one has not thought of a subject for some time, it may be difficult to recall details. After thinking our way back into the appropriate context and finding the general location in our memory, the interconnections become more readily available. We begin to remember names, places, and events that had seemed to be forgotten. Once people have started thinking about a problem one way, the same mental circuits or pathways get activated and strengthened each time they think about it. This facilitates the retrieval of information. These same pathways, however, also become the mental ruts that make it difficult to reorganize the information mentally so as to see it from a different perspective. One useful concept of memory organization is what some cognitive psychologists call a \"schema.\" A schema is any pattern of relationships among data stored in memory. It is any set of nodes and links between them in the spider web of memory that hang together so strongly that they can be retrieved and used more or less as a single unit.","title":"Organization of Information in memory"},{"location":"General/DeBono_Thinking_critical_critical_thinking/#getting-information-into-and-out-of-long-term-memory","text":"The key factor in transferring information from short-term to long-term memory is the development of associations between the new information and schemata already available in memory . This, in turn, depends upon two variables: the extent to which the information to be learned relates to an already existing schema, and the level of processing given to the new information. Depth (level) of processing refers to the amount of effort and cognitive capacity employed to process information, and the number and strength of associations that are thereby forged between the data to be learned and knowledge already in memory. The following illustrative tasks are listed in order of the depth of mental processing required: Say how many letters there are in each word on the list Give a word that rhymes with each word Make a mental image of each word, make up a story that incorporates each word. Memory Rarely Changes Retroactively. Memories are seldom reassessed or reorganized retroactively in response to new information. For example, information that is dismissed as unimportant or irrelevant because it did not fit an analyst's expectations does not become more memorable even if the analyst changes his or her thinking to the point where the same information, received today, would be recognized as very significant.

The lateral thinker says: 'I am looking but I won't know what I am looking for until I have found it.'\" Lateral thinking is both an attitude of mind and also a number of defined methods. The attitude of mind involves the willingness to try to look at things in different ways. It involves an appreciation that any way of looking at things is only one amongst many possible ways. It involves an understanding of how the mind uses patterns and the need to escape from an established pattern to switch into a better one. Vertical thinking is analytical, lateral thinking is provocative Lateral thinking has to do with change, especially when change involves escaping from a pattern that has been satisfactory in the past. The usual method of change is through criticism and attack. The weakness of that method is that we can only consider change when a concept can be shown to be inadequate and when the attacking party has the power to carry through the change. It may be necessary to be on the top of a mountain in order to find the best way up. With vertical thinking one has to be correct at every step, with lateral thinking one does not have to be Hindsight and insight : We switch to a new pattern and suddenly see that something is reasonable and obvious. In hindsight any creative idea must be logical -- otherwise we could never accept it as having a value. The mistake we make is to assume that since it is logical in hindsight then the better exercise of logic could have got us there in the first place.

The brain as a computer if CPU #1 is hogging the bus, CPU #2 can't get at memory to perform searches. Similarly, if CPU #2 is cranking away on a high-priority search, CPU #1 cannot get at memory either. They interfere with each other. R -mode Sees Forest; L-mode Sees Trees L-Mode CPU #1 is probably the most familiar to you: it is chie\ufb02y responsible for linear, logical thought, and language processing. CPU #1 is relatively slow and uses a relatively small amount of overall brain real estate. It's programmed with an \"idle loop\" routine as well. If CPU #1 is not processing anything else, it will simply generate an internal stream of verbal chatter. It's that little voice in your head. R-Mode CPU #2 is more like a magic digital signal processor. It's your brain's answer to Google: think of it like a super regular-expression search engine, responsible for searching and pattern matching. As such, it might grab matching patterns that aren't obviously related. It can go off searching while you are \"thinking\" of something else and return a result set asynchronously---and possibly days later. Since CPU #2 doesn't do any verbal processing, that means its results aren't verbal, either. It can retrieve and recognize verbal elements, but it can't do anything with them by itself because of that memory bus contention between L-mode and R -mode. For instance, have you ever had the experience of trying to describe a dream when you \ufb01rst wake up? Many times it seems that a crystal-clear, vivid dream evaporates from your memory as soon as you try to describe it in words. That's because the images, feelings, and overall experience are R -mode things: your dream was generated in R -mode. As you try to put your dream into words, you experience a sort of bus contention. L-mode takes over the bus, and now you can't get at those memories anymore. In effect, they aren't verbalizable. You have amazing perceptual powers, many of which can't be effectively put into words. For instance, you can instantly recognize the faces of a large number of familiar people. It doesn't matter whether they've changed their hairstyle, changed their manner of dress, or put on ten pounds or twenty years. But try to describe the face of even your closest loved one. How do you put that recognition ability into words? Can you make a database describing the faces of the people you know in such a way that you could recognize them based on that description? R -mode is quite diligent at storing input. In fact, it's possible that every experience you have, no matter how mundane, is stored. But it is not necessarily indexed. Researchers in Japan did a study of a bank's ATM interfaces; subjects found the aesthetically pleasing button layouts much easier to use than the ugly ones, even though the functionality and work\ufb02ow was the same. Positive emotions are essential to learning and creative thinking. Being \"happy\" broadens your thought processes and brings more of the brain's hardware online. Creativity comes from the selection and assembly of just the right components in just the right presentation to create the work. And selection---knowing what to select and in what context---comes from pattern matching. R -mode to L-mode \ufb02ow Add sensory experience to engage more of your brain. For instance, try \ufb01ddling with a paper clip or some sort of tactile puzzle while stuck on a tedious conference call or while pondering a tricky problem. When you involve an additional input mode, you are activating more areas of the brain---you're bringing more processing power online, as it were. What we need is a better way of synchronizing our L-mode and R -mode processing so that the whole mind can work better and more ef\ufb01ciently. Example rock climbing lessons where the instructor first let the participants climb for 30 minutes before starting the formal lecture. He \ufb01rst presented a multisensory, experiential context so that participants could \"get our heads around it,\" as it were. Then he followed up with a more traditional, fact-\ufb01lled lecture. Don't be in such a hurry. When problem solving, learn to be comfortable with uncertainty. When creating, be comfortable with the absurd and the impractical. When learning, don't try so hard to learn and memorize; just get \"used to it\" \ufb01rst. Try to understand the meaning \ufb01rst; get the overall gist of it. Then follow up with traditional L-mode activities to get to the next step: an R -mode to L-mode \ufb02ow. Metaphor, a common ground for both verbalizations and images, is a way to voyage back and forth between the subconscious and conscious, between right and left hemispheres. Metaphor comes from the Greek meaning \"to transfer,\" with the idea that you are transferring the properties of one object to another in a way that is not literally possible. Trust ink over memory; every mental read is a write. Instead, augment your memory with some kind of reality check. Whether it's notes that you keep or a conversation with someone else with their own memories, you need something to help keep your memories from drifting too far from reality. http://themindsetlist.com/lists/the-mindset-list-for-the-class-of-2018-born-in-1996/ Coursera learning to learn The better you get at something the more you can enjoy it Diffuse mode (more big picture thinking (lots of space between the bumpers in the pinball analogy)) Try taking a \\\"picture walk\\\" through the material to gain big picture context before diving into the detail Focused mode (focused attention, step by step, small spaces between the bumpers) Hard practice makes for better understanding and better retention of information Recall from memory Practicing the hard stuff (don't overdo the easy things) Mini tests (coding challenges) Interleaving with different kinds of information or practicing in different ways/in different environments Use pen and paper rather than digital Use breaks Building chunks (connected pieces of information) Focused attention Understanding (basic idea rather than 100%) Sometimes it's better to move on in order to understand the big picture Practice There is a bottom up chunking process where practice and repetition can help you both build and strengthen each chunk, so you can easily gain access to it when needed.

They are skilled at creating and noticing chance opportunities make lucky decisions by listening to their intuition create self-fulfilling prophesies via positive expectations Adopt a resilient attitude that transforms bad luck into good. Unlucky people often fail to follow their intuition when making a choice, whereas lucky people tend to respect hunches. Lucky people are interested in how they both think and feel about the various options, rather than simply looking at the rational side of the situation. I think this helps them because gut feelings act as an alarm bell - a reason to consider a decision carefully. Unlucky people tend to be creatures of routine. They tend to take the same route to and from work and talk to the same types of people at parties. In contrast, many lucky people try to introduce variety into their lives. For example, one person described how he thought of a colour before arriving at a party and then introduced himself to people wearing that colour. This kind of behaviour boosts the likelihood of chance opportunities by introducing variety. Lucky people tend to see the positive side of their ill fortune. They imagine how things could have been worse. In one interview, a lucky volunteer arrived with his leg in a plaster cast and described how he had fallen down a flight of stairs. I asked him whether he still felt lucky and he cheerfully explained that he felt luckier than before. As he pointed out, he could have broken his neck.

CPU #1 is relatively slow and uses a relatively small amount of overall brain real estate. It's programmed with an \"idle loop\" routine as well. If CPU #1 is not processing anything else, it will simply generate an internal stream of verbal chatter. It's that little voice in your head.","title":"L-Mode"},{"location":"General/Learning_about_learning/#r-mode","text":"CPU #2 is more like a magic digital signal processor. It's your brain's answer to Google: think of it like a super regular-expression search engine, responsible for searching and pattern matching. As such, it might grab matching patterns that aren't obviously related. It can go off searching while you are \"thinking\" of something else and return a result set asynchronously---and possibly days later. Since CPU #2 doesn't do any verbal processing, that means its results aren't verbal, either. It can retrieve and recognize verbal elements, but it can't do anything with them by itself because of that memory bus contention between L-mode and R -mode. For instance, have you ever had the experience of trying to describe a dream when you \ufb01rst wake up? Many times it seems that a crystal-clear, vivid dream evaporates from your memory as soon as you try to describe it in words. That's because the images, feelings, and overall experience are R -mode things: your dream was generated in R -mode. As you try to put your dream into words, you experience a sort of bus contention. L-mode takes over the bus, and now you can't get at those memories anymore. In effect, they aren't verbalizable. You have amazing perceptual powers, many of which can't be effectively put into words. For instance, you can instantly recognize the faces of a large number of familiar people. It doesn't matter whether they've changed their hairstyle, changed their manner of dress, or put on ten pounds or twenty years. But try to describe the face of even your closest loved one. How do you put that recognition ability into words? Can you make a database describing the faces of the people you know in such a way that you could recognize them based on that description? R -mode is quite diligent at storing input. In fact, it's possible that every experience you have, no matter how mundane, is stored. But it is not necessarily indexed. Researchers in Japan did a study of a bank's ATM interfaces; subjects found the aesthetically pleasing button layouts much easier to use than the ugly ones, even though the functionality and work\ufb02ow was the same. Positive emotions are essential to learning and creative thinking. Being \"happy\" broadens your thought processes and brings more of the brain's hardware online. Creativity comes from the selection and assembly of just the right components in just the right presentation to create the work. And selection---knowing what to select and in what context---comes from pattern matching.","title":"R-Mode"},{"location":"General/Learning_about_learning/#r-mode-to-l-mode-flow","text":"Add sensory experience to engage more of your brain. For instance, try \ufb01ddling with a paper clip or some sort of tactile puzzle while stuck on a tedious conference call or while pondering a tricky problem. When you involve an additional input mode, you are activating more areas of the brain---you're bringing more processing power online, as it were. What we need is a better way of synchronizing our L-mode and R -mode processing so that the whole mind can work better and more ef\ufb01ciently. Example rock climbing lessons where the instructor first let the participants climb for 30 minutes before starting the formal lecture. He \ufb01rst presented a multisensory, experiential context so that participants could \"get our heads around it,\" as it were. Then he followed up with a more traditional, fact-\ufb01lled lecture. Don't be in such a hurry. When problem solving, learn to be comfortable with uncertainty. When creating, be comfortable with the absurd and the impractical. When learning, don't try so hard to learn and memorize; just get \"used to it\" \ufb01rst. Try to understand the meaning \ufb01rst; get the overall gist of it. Then follow up with traditional L-mode activities to get to the next step: an R -mode to L-mode \ufb02ow. Metaphor, a common ground for both verbalizations and images, is a way to voyage back and forth between the subconscious and conscious, between right and left hemispheres. Metaphor comes from the Greek meaning \"to transfer,\" with the idea that you are transferring the properties of one object to another in a way that is not literally possible. Trust ink over memory; every mental read is a write. Instead, augment your memory with some kind of reality check. Whether it's notes that you keep or a conversation with someone else with their own memories, you need something to help keep your memories from drifting too far from reality. http://themindsetlist.com/lists/the-mindset-list-for-the-class-of-2018-born-in-1996/","title":"R -mode to L-mode \ufb02ow"},{"location":"General/Learning_about_learning/#coursera-learning-to-learn","text":"The better you get at something the more you can enjoy it Diffuse mode (more big picture thinking (lots of space between the bumpers in the pinball analogy)) Try taking a \\\"picture walk\\\" through the material to gain big picture context before diving into the detail Focused mode (focused attention, step by step, small spaces between the bumpers) Hard practice makes for better understanding and better retention of information Recall from memory Practicing the hard stuff (don't overdo the easy things) Mini tests (coding challenges) Interleaving with different kinds of information or practicing in different ways/in different environments Use pen and paper rather than digital Use breaks Building chunks (connected pieces of information) Focused attention Understanding (basic idea rather than 100%) Sometimes it's better to move on in order to understand the big picture Practice There is a bottom up chunking process where practice and repetition can help you both build and strengthen each chunk, so you can easily gain access to it when needed.

They are skilled at creating and noticing chance opportunities make lucky decisions by listening to their intuition create self-fulfilling prophesies via positive expectations Adopt a resilient attitude that transforms bad luck into good. Unlucky people often fail to follow their intuition when making a choice, whereas lucky people tend to respect hunches. Lucky people are interested in how they both think and feel about the various options, rather than simply looking at the rational side of the situation. I think this helps them because gut feelings act as an alarm bell - a reason to consider a decision carefully. Unlucky people tend to be creatures of routine. They tend to take the same route to and from work and talk to the same types of people at parties. In contrast, many lucky people try to introduce variety into their lives. For example, one person described how he thought of a colour before arriving at a party and then introduced himself to people wearing that colour. This kind of behaviour boosts the likelihood of chance opportunities by introducing variety. Lucky people tend to see the positive side of their ill fortune. They imagine how things could have been worse. In one interview, a lucky volunteer arrived with his leg in a plaster cast and described how he had fallen down a flight of stairs.

Make us of the community Partner with people that complement your skills Dreamer vs. Doer. Share your ideas Sharing ideas significantly increases the odds of ideas gaining momentum and ultimately happening. Creative professionals and entrepreneurs alike claim that they become more committed to their ideas after telling people about them. Capitalize on feedback While the value of feedback is high, the incentive to give feedback to others is low---and the actual desire to hear it is often nonexistent. After all, the work you do to pursue your ideas is a labor of love. The last thing anyone wants is to hear harsh truths about a loved one. Start/Stop/Continue Send an e-mail to each team member/stakeholder requesting a few feedback points for each participant under the headings START, STOP, and CONTINUE Each recipient is asked to share a few things that each of their colleagues and clients should START, STOP, and CONTINUE doing People then return their lists to the team's leader (except for the feedback about the leader, which is redirected to someone else on the team) The points under each heading are aggregated to identify the larger trends Isolated points mentioned by only one person are discarded Common themes are then shared in a personal meeting with each member of the team. This method not only serve to gather intelligence in the course of making ideas happen but also send a message to your community of collaborators and clients. The message suggests that you are open to feedback, that you are constantly improving, and that you are actively learning. Transparency Boosts Communal Forces Self-marketing in a good way A good self-marketing strategy should start with intrinsic interests that can become personal projects---projects that demonstrate your strengths. As your strengths become utilized, people will start to respect you for something that is real---something that is earned. The ability to gather and present your past accomplishments visually in a \"show, don't tell\" framework is much more effective than having a list of clients or distributing a resum\u00e9. Identify your differentiating attributes. Self-marketing should start with identifying the strengths that differentiate you from others. Develop a communications strategy. Be introspective and advocate for the unique perspective that you bring to every project and problem. People will likely respect the efforts you take and the decisions you make when they understand the source of your strengths and ambitions. While at work, you might consider volunteering for internal or side projects that will best showcase your strengths and take full advantage of your differentiating attributes. Leadership Leadership is about instilling a genuine desire in the hearts and minds of others to take ownership of their work on a project. Only then can we act together, motivated by a shared purpose. Getting people excited about your idea, however, is just the first phase of sharing ownership. The second and much more challenging part is empowering team members to push the idea forward rather than micromanaging them every step of the way. Ultimately, truly sharing ownership of ideas means permitting your team members, the people you have entrusted with the fate of the project, to make meaningful decisions ---even decisions that you might have made differently. The best creative leaders are able to recognize that the cost of variation from their original vision is often outweighed by the benefits of shared ownership and the scalability that it provides. You want your collaborators to stay up at night thinking about how to execute the ideas at hand---in their own way. Different people will make different decisions. The question is: Did their alternate approach make a material difference? As long as the desired outcome is achieved, controlling how it is achieved shouldn't be that important to you. Self-Leadership As you lead others in creative pursuits, you are your greatest liability. Self-leadership is about awareness, tolerance, and not letting your own natural tendencies limit your potential. Our best hope for staying on track is to notice when we stray and to figure out why---to be self-aware. Self-awareness is a critical skill in leadership, but it is deeply personal. It is not about our actions but about the emotions that trigger our actions. With increased self-awareness, we become better students of ourselves. When we make mistakes, we are able to identify what we could have done better more readily. When we receive feedback from others, it becomes more actionable as we come to understand its correlation with our emotions. The path to self-awareness never ends, but we must traverse it nonetheless. Emerging leaders in the creative world benefit from some sort of psychological development in their lives. An early commitment to developing self-awareness will yield better judgment. In turn, sound judgment builds lasting relationships and great decisions ---the kind that garner the respect and confidence you need to lead bold pursuits. Previous knowledge is yours for the taking, often risk-free and time-tested. Today never feels like it will be history, but it will. And more likely than not, you will look back and realize that you should have known. The creative process is also a process of engagement Enabling new or less- experienced members of your team to share their ideas is how you can develop their reasoning and bring them onboard. Instead of overshadowing their ideas with your own brilliant insights, silence yourself and welcome fresh, though sometimes na\u00efve, insights. Challenge yourself to ask questions before making statements. When you are not talking, you should be listening. Even those leaders who do recognize the value of talking last sometimes fail to listen while they are waiting to speak. Leaders should talk last After many years in an industry, visionary leaders become revered by others and convince themselves that they have seen it all before. As a result, these leaders are liable to talk first, act quickly, and fail to engage others. Unplug from the traditional rewards system. Stay engaged by setting up a system of incremental rewards. Happiness is its own reward. At Zappos, happiness serves as a form of compensation without limits or tangible costs. Not only is it a core value of the culture, but it frees up financial resources that can be used in other ways---perhaps to lower prices for customers or pay for free overnight shipping. Happiness is the company's most valuable currency. As you push ideas forward, you should make use of alternative rewards that keep you ---and your team---engaged with your long-term pursuits. The traditional methods for acknowledging progress---financial rewards and celebrity am ong them---are unlikely tobe available to you in the early stages of making ideas happen. Putting an emphasis on happiness changes the types of goals you pursue as well as how you hire and manage people along the way. Recognize contribution of the team Success is more than a personal reward for leaders; it is a valuable currency that can be distributed to the team. The only bank account that the shared credit depletes is the leader's ego. Recognition is a powerful reward that, whether or not money is tight, can help further engage those who play a role in making your ideas happen. Hire people who exemplify initiation skills and intrinsic motivation As you assemble teams around creative projects, probe candidates for their true interests---whatever they may be---and then measure the extent to which the candidate has pursued those interests. Ask for specific examples and seek to understand the lapses of time between interest and action. When you stumble across an Initiator ---someone who has passion, generates ideas, and tends to take action---recognize your good fortune. Nothing will assist your ideas more than a team of people who possess real initiative. Provide an environment with flexibility for productivity Rather than focusing on face time, creative teams should embrace transparency and strive to build a fundamental trust between colleagues. As leaders, we must create rules and norms for the sake of efficiency rather than as a result of mistrust. We should measure tangible outputs like actions taken and quality of outcomes. ROWE (Results Only Work Environment): The ultimate goal is to empower employees to make their own decisions about when and where they work as long as mutually agreed-upon goals are achieved. This means that bosses stop watching employee calendars and paying attention to when people arrive and leave the office. There must be a shared level of trust and commitment to ensure that this autonomy is used for good purposes. More important, operating successfully in an autonomous environment requires that a concrete set of goals be established and constantly revisited. ROWE and other attempts at hands-off management fail miserably when objectives and goals are not mutually agreed upon and tightly managed. Many managers struggle to establish and repeatedly review goals with their teams. And, when a team falls short on goals, managers must confront it. Focus and staying on track vs. new ideas/innovation The great challenge is to balance idea generation and relentless focus. While you don't want to behave like a large company that locks down all creativity from the point of production, you also don't want to act like a fledgling start-up that is always generating new ideas and features that saturate the project, ultimately getting in the way of execution. Finding the right balance requires allocating time for open idea exchange along with a healthy level of intolerance for idea generation during execution. One approach is to have a bias toward considering ideas during brainstorming sessions and killing ideas when they come up randomly during execution. Your resident skeptics can be helpful on this front. Of course, great ideas may still crop up unexpectedly, but when they do your bias should be to stay focused on the project at hand. With this approach, only the mightiest of ideas---those worthy of deep consideration---will risk getting you off track. Welcome friction and disagreement Conflict is a common occurrence in any creative process. It is a good sign, a powerful opportunity to refine your ideas and processes. Despite the frustration that friction causes, it will serve you in the long run if you are able to manage it. The leaders of great creative teams value the friction that results when opinions vary among a passionate group of creative minds. If good chemistry has been cultivated, teams can use disagreements to foster valuable insights that would otherwise be inaccessible. Yet despite the opportunities that conflict provides, our tendency is to shy away from it. We will often completely disengage when a creative process becomes heated. Conflict happens very easily. For any problem, there are multiple possible solutions ---some better than others. In a diverse team, there will be many different opinions. Fighting is uncomfortable, but consider the benefits of opposing perspectives duking it out. Imagine that the answer to a problem lies somewhere on a spectrum between A and B. The more arguing that takes place about both ends of the spectrum, the more likely it is that the complete terrain of possibilities will be adequately explored. By contrast, if the advocates for A just give up, then B becomes the default answer without any better solution being discovered in between. Some of the most admired creative teams share a common tenet---they are comfortable fighting out their disagreements and diverse points of view, but they always share conviction after the meeting. These teams recognize that the purpose of disagreement is to more fully explore the options. Fighting, as it turns out, is an asset for the teams that can stomach it. But the animosity is released when the exercise is over. Your team is more likely to conceive breakthroughs if its chemistry is strong enough to capitalize on conflict. Thoughtful leaders use conflict as an opportunity to align and strengthen their teams. Feedback via appreciations Appreciations is a technique that is used to improve students' skills without any demoralizing consequences. It's a unique form of feedback that helps to focus on developing strengths. Here's the concept behind appreciations: having just shared a story (or, in other contexts, a presentation or idea), you go around and ask people to comment on the elements they most appreciated. The exchange of appreciations is meant to help you build upon your strengths, with the underlying assumption that a creative craft is made extraordinary through developing your strengths rather than obsessing over your weaknesses. If our eyes are always looking for weakness, we begin to lose the intuition to notice the beauty. Institute a round of appreciation-based refinement with your team prior to your formal process of critique. Your projects---and the skills of your colleagues---will be refined more organically by doing so. This change in the process of feedback exchange will not only improve output but also enrich the team's chemistry. Think win-win without requiring 100% consensus While most people might feel that incorporating two extremely different viewpoints (or features) into a project would call for an \"either/or\" decision that dispenses with one extreme, consensus can often be achieved by taking an \"and/and\" approach. Leaders of creative teams should identify and highlight the noteworthy, memorable solutions at both ends of the spectrum that, in all likelihood, are not agreeable to all. Over the course of discussions, they should seek to identify the few of these outliers worth fighting for amidst the other inevitable compromises when dealing with other constituencies. These sacred extremes are the ideas that you want to hold on to amidst all of the other compromises you will need to make. Sometimes someone with a particular expertise should be empowered to vouch for the sacred extremes and make the final decision despite an uncertain team. We should be open to trying something new, especially when someone we respect is advocating for it.","title":"Making ideas happen"},{"location":"General/Making_ideas_happen/#organization-and-execution","text":"","title":"Organization and execution"},{"location":"General/Making_ideas_happen/#action-method","text":"Everything in life is a project, and every project must be broken down into Action Steps, References, and Backburner Items.

As leaders, we must create rules and norms for the sake of efficiency rather than as a result of mistrust. We should measure tangible outputs like actions taken and quality of outcomes. ROWE (Results Only Work Environment): The ultimate goal is to empower employees to make their own decisions about when and where they work as long as mutually agreed-upon goals are achieved. This means that bosses stop watching employee calendars and paying attention to when people arrive and leave the office. There must be a shared level of trust and commitment to ensure that this autonomy is used for good purposes. More important, operating successfully in an autonomous environment requires that a concrete set of goals be established and constantly revisited. ROWE and other attempts at hands-off management fail miserably when objectives and goals are not mutually agreed upon and tightly managed. Many managers struggle to establish and repeatedly review goals with their teams. And, when a team falls short on goals, managers must confront it.","title":"Provide an environment with flexibility for productivity"},{"location":"General/Making_ideas_happen/#focus-and-staying-on-track-vs-new-ideasinnovation","text":"The great challenge is to balance idea generation and relentless focus. While you don't want to behave like a large company that locks down all creativity from the point of production, you also don't want to act like a fledgling start-up that is always generating new ideas and features that saturate the project, ultimately getting in the way of execution. Finding the right balance requires allocating time for open idea exchange along with a healthy level of intolerance for idea generation during execution. One approach is to have a bias toward considering ideas during brainstorming sessions and killing ideas when they come up randomly during execution. Your resident skeptics can be helpful on this front. Of course, great ideas may still crop up unexpectedly, but when they do your bias should be to stay focused on the project at hand. With this approach, only the mightiest of ideas---those worthy of deep consideration---will risk getting you off track.","title":"Focus and staying on track vs. new ideas/innovation"},{"location":"General/Making_ideas_happen/#welcome-friction-and-disagreement","text":"Conflict is a common occurrence in any creative process. It is a good sign, a powerful opportunity to refine your ideas and processes. Despite the frustration that friction causes, it will serve you in the long run if you are able to manage it. The leaders of great creative teams value the friction that results when opinions vary among a passionate group of creative minds. If good chemistry has been cultivated, teams can use disagreements to foster valuable insights that would otherwise be inaccessible. Yet despite the opportunities that conflict provides, our tendency is to shy away from it. We will often completely disengage when a creative process becomes heated. Conflict happens very easily. For any problem, there are multiple possible solutions ---some better than others. In a diverse team, there will be many different opinions. Fighting is uncomfortable, but consider the benefits of opposing perspectives duking it out. Imagine that the answer to a problem lies somewhere on a spectrum between A and B. The more arguing that takes place about both ends of the spectrum, the more likely it is that the complete terrain of possibilities will be adequately explored. By contrast, if the advocates for A just give up, then B becomes the default answer without any better solution being discovered in between. Some of the most admired creative teams share a common tenet---they are comfortable fighting out their disagreements and diverse points of view, but they always share conviction after the meeting. These teams recognize that the purpose of disagreement is to more fully explore the options. Fighting, as it turns out, is an asset for the teams that can stomach it. But the animosity is released when the exercise is over. Your team is more likely to conceive breakthroughs if its chemistry is strong enough to capitalize on conflict. Thoughtful leaders use conflict as an opportunity to align and strengthen their teams.","title":"Welcome friction and disagreement"},{"location":"General/Making_ideas_happen/#feedback-via-appreciations","text":"Appreciations is a technique that is used to improve students' skills without any demoralizing consequences. It's a unique form of feedback that helps to focus on developing strengths. Here's the concept behind appreciations: having just shared a story (or, in other contexts, a presentation or idea), you go around and ask people to comment on the elements they most appreciated. The exchange of appreciations is meant to help you build upon your strengths, with the underlying assumption that a creative craft is made extraordinary through developing your strengths rather than obsessing over your weaknesses. If our eyes are always looking for weakness, we begin to lose the intuition to notice the beauty. Institute a round of appreciation-based refinement with your team prior to your formal process of critique.

Over the course of discussions, they should seek to identify the few of these outliers worth fighting for amidst the other inevitable compromises when dealing with other constituencies. These sacred extremes are the ideas that you want to hold on to amidst all of the other compromises you will need to make.

The length of the arrow indicates the magnitude of the force. If multiple forces act on an object operation on the vectors need to be carried out in order to calculate the forces. Vector addition: Trigonometry Adjacent and opposite = relative to theta (the angel to be found) Hypothenuse = longest side of triangle Any of the functions can be used to solve for theta. e.g. Sin.

Break up a vector into X and Y components Example calculations Hypotenuse = SQRT(16 + 1) Angle = Inverse tan (1/4) = 14.04 degrees Position Velocity Acceleration Position Distance is a scalar (how much have you moved?) and displacement is a vector (since it also includes the direction of the movement): While both friends walk different differences they both have the same displacement since they end up in the same place. Velocity Change in position per unit of time (5m/5s = 1m/s) Speed is a scalar (since it only describes the magnitude) and velocity is a vector (since it describes the magnitude and the direction) Velocity can also be negative Acceleration Change in velocity over time: Start velocity = 0 m/s End velocity = 5 m/s Time 5 s 5m/s per 5s $\\frac{5m}{5ss}$=$\\frac{1m}{\\text{ss}}$ = 1m/s^2^ Acceleration is a vector and can be positive or negative (negative acceleration will point backwards) Graphical analysis Kinematics Galileo discovered that the distance an object falls is proportional to the square root of time: E.g. if the object travels 1m in 1s it will travel 4m in 2s and 16m in 4s. Furthermore the acceleration that is acted upon the object is gravity which is on earth 9.81 m/s^2^ Gravity speeds up a falling object by 9.81m/s for every seconds it drops after one second, an object will have fallen a distance of 1/2 \u00d7 9.8 \u00d7 1^2^ = 4.9 m.

The horizontal and vertical motion are independent of each other and are also measured independently: E.g. if one marble is pushed from a table (with some force in the horizontal direction) and another is just dropped from the same height. Their y-direction velocities and time in the air are identical. Inertial reference frame How long does it take for the rock to hit the ground? (only dependent on y-direction e.g. gravity) How far away from the cliff will it land? (dependent on both vectors) Horizontal velocity will be constant but vertical velocity will decrease Initial velocities in x and y directions Cos 30 degrees = adj./hyp. Vx = adj.

Assuming as if the earth would stand still and not fly through the universe. The earth is in this case used as an inertial reference frame (we pretend it does not move). When we move with a constant velocity (no acceleration or deceleration) in a straight line we are not able to distinguish whether we move or not. If you throw a ball up into the air while you are on a train. To you it will feel as if the ball goes up and down in a straight line. From the perspective of the train the ball has no horizontal velocity. From the perspective of someone standing outside the train the ball will move in a curve since from their inertial reference frame there is a horizontal velocity which is the speed of the train. Forces Force: any interaction that if unopposed will alter the motion of an object. Four fundamental forces: strong nuclear force weak nuclear force electromagnetic force gravity Force unit of measure = Newton One Newton is force it takes to accelerate a mass of 1kg by 1 m/s^2^ 1 N = 1 kg * 1 m/s^2^ Newton's 1^st^ law of motion (law of inertia) An object at rest will remain at rest and an object in motion will remain in motion unless acted upon by some external net force. Objects with a greater mass have a higher inertia, it is harder to move and stop them from moving. In space there is almost no friction or wind therefore objects move with a constant velocity in space unless they are accelerated or decelerated or affected by other forces (e.g. gravitation pull of a planet) Newton's 2^nd^ law of motion Describes what will happen if there is indeed a net force (sum of vectors of forces will be positive). F = ma ; force = mass x accelation If no (net) force is applied to an object: ma = 0 Since every object has a mass != 0 it follows that a must be 0 (m*0=0). If no net force acts on a body it undergoes no acceleration and must therefore be either at rest or travelling at a constant velocity. The above is an expression of Newton' s 1. law and proves that the 1. law is just a special case of the 2^nd^ law of motion. Bigger mass requires more force to achieve the same acceleration: 1m/s^2^ = 25 N / 25 kg; 1m/s^2^ = 5 N / 5 kg Newton's 3^rd^ law of motion For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction Whenever a body exerts a force on a second body, the second body exerts a force on the first body. The forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. If every force involves an equal and opposite counterforce why don't the two forces always cancel out by vector addition? This happens only when they are exerted on the same body. The law of interaction involves equal and opposite forces exerted on two separate bodies. If you push a rock the rock also pushes you in the opposite direction ( usually this is not noticeable because of friction between your shoes and the ground). (The horse is pulling the wagon and the wagon pulls the horse.) Mass vs. Weight vs normal force Mass is a scalar in kg = the amount of matter an object contains Weight is a vector (having magnitude and direction) Weight -> The force exerted on an object by virtue of its position in a gravitational field. The force with which a body is attracted to the earth. Objects and mass are proportional (object with more mass will weigh more) Weight -> F = ma where a = gravity on earth (W=mg) mass * gravity Weight = 100kg * 9.81 m/s^2^ = 981 Newton Mass will not change but the weight changes depending on location (outside earth) Normal force Is the force opposite to weight. It is exerted by whatever surface an object sits on and it points in the direction that is perpendicular to the surface. On a flat horizontal surface the normal force directly opposes weight (they both have the same magnitude) and the object will remain still. Friction A surface exerts two forces on a moving object. Normal force (see above) and the frictional force which acts perpendicular to movement of the object in the opposite direction. Static friction resists the initiation of motion. The static friction increases as more force is applied to an object in order to move it. The friction will increase (it will equal the applied moving force) until its maximum before the object starts moving. Each surface has a different friction coefficient, the max force to move an object can be calculated as follows:\\ Kinetic friction resists the motion of a moving object Kinetic friction is less than static friction Air and water also have friction Work and Energy Work Work -> Action done on an object that displaces the object. W = Fd (Force * displacement magnitude) e.g. (100 N)(10 m) = 1000 Nm = 1000 J (joules) only the component of force parallel to the displacement counts towards work (e.g. Fx) Work can also be negative if the work applied is in the opposite direction of the movement of the object. Energy Energy -> The capacity to do work Conversation of energy (kinetic) Momentum = mass * velocity (mv) (kg*m/s) Momentum -> Quantity of motion present in a body. Kinetic energy = \u00bd * mass * (velocity)^2^ Kinetic energy -> the work needed to accelerate a body of a given mass from rest to its stated velocity. Kinetic energy = accumulated momentum as velocity changes : mv vs. \u00bd * mv^2^ There are different types of energy: Kinetic energy Kinetic energy -> The energy an object possesses by virtue of its motion W = Fd F = ma W = mad Potential energy The energy an object possesses by virtue of it position in a field. If you a lift a ball into the air, the higher you lift it the more you will increase its gravitational potential energy. If you drop the ball from a height the potential gravitational energy is converted into kinetic energy. The closer an object is to the gravitational center of the earth the less potential energy it has. Also a compressed spring or a bow in an arrow has that potential energy (elastic potential energy) Gravitational potential energy: PE = mgh kg * 9.81 m/s^2^ * height in meters Newton's law of universal gravitation When a canon is fired with greater force it hits the ground later. If a canon could be fired with a great force it would never hit the ground since its velocity would counter the gravitational force and orbit around the earth. A satellite maintains its orbit by balancing two factors: its velocity (the speed it takes to travel in a straight line since objects in a vacuum keep going in straight line) and the gravitational pull that Earth has on it. A satellite orbiting closer to the Earth requires more velocity to resist the stronger gravitational pull. Since F = ma a = f/m = G * m/r^2^ F~G~ = Gravitational force between to objects m~1~ = mass of first object r = radius = distance between the two object's centre of gravity. Earth and moon exert the same gravitational force at each other The earth-moon system rotate around its center of mass (which lies within earth but not its center) Since F=ma and a = f/m the moon is moving much faster than the earth. More massive objects have more inertia, or resistance to being accelerated. The gravitational force decreases with the inverse square of distance. The moon is roughly 60 times further from the center of the earth than something on the surface of the earth and therefore the gravitational force is 60*60 weaker. Gravity on earth decreases with altitude but even more so the closer you move towards the equator since the shape of the earth bulges towards its centre due to centrifugal forces (as if you squash a soft ball) Therefore, the gravitational force is stronger at the poles than (9.82) than at the equator (9.79) Fluid buoyancy Archimedes Liquids and gases are both fluids Density = mass / volume Buoyancy = upward force exerted on an object by a fluid it is submerged into An object floats if its density is lower than that of water (1g/cm^3^). Because the displaced water by the object is of the same volume as the object but has more weight therefore producing a greater buoyancy force than the object's weight. This is because a submerged object will experience a buoyant force equal to the weight of the displaced fluid. A floating object displaces fluid based on its mass. (Water level/buoyancy based on mass) A sinking object displaces fluid based on its volume. (Water level rises based on volume) Misc Age of the universe 13.7 billions years. Age of the earth \\<> 4 billion years Black holes have at their center near infinite gravity, since gravity also influences time, time almost stands still at this point. Time runs slower and objects gets shorter if watching an object that moves near speed of light from outside the object. Light http://thehappyneuron.com/2020/12/there-are-no-green-stars/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=there-are-no-green-stars But what is this light? Light is simply perpendicular waves in the electrical and magnetic fields. When one goes up and down, the other goes left and right. Together they are called an electromagnetic wave, or EM wave. EM waves include the X-rays fired at you by your doctor, the microwaves heating your left overs, the radio waves bringing you your favorite tunes, the light detected by your eye, etc. It's all the same stuff, the only differences being its wavelength, which is the distance between each crest or trough, and its frequency, which is the rate at which it oscillates. The higher the temperature, the shorter the wavelength and therefore the higher the frequency. Blue stars appear blue because they are hotter and emit most of their light in the blue part of the visible spectrum. And red stars are red because they are cooler and emit a majority of red light. Infra red = beyond red = long wave length (heat camera even longer and micro-waves -> radio waves) Ultra violet = very violet = short wave length (x-ray even shorter) Color is seen by different objects absorbing certain parts of the light and reflecting the remainder of the spectrum. Temperature and heat Temperature -> the amount of heat energy available for work in a system this relates to the average kinetic energy of the molecules in the system Higher temperature = faster moving particles. A hot object will have kinetic energy more faster which means moving particles. Heat moves from hot to cold. Substances do not contain heat, heat is a transfer of internal energy To make an engine more efficient one needs to increase the heat difference between the engine (heat source) and the cooler surroundings Entropy Based on observations of steam engines Work = Heat energy input -- heat energy lost (friction, sound). No such flow exists. Entropy -> The entropy of an object is a measure of the amount of energy which is unavailable to do work . Entropy is also a measure of the number of possible arrangements the atoms in a system can have. In this sense, entropy is a measure of uncertainty or randomness . The higher the entropy of an object, the more uncertain we are about the states of the atoms making up that object because there are more states to decide from. A law of physics says that it takes work to make the entropy of an object or system smaller; without work, entropy can never become smaller -- you could say that everything slowly goes to disorder (or being from more concentrated into more dispersed) (higher entropy). Number of arrangements for identical objects (based on combinations): Arrange 5 books in 3 shelves n = 5 + 3 -1 = 7 r = 3 -- 1 = 2 =FACT(7)/(FACT(2)*FACT(7)) or combin(7,2) https://aatishb.com/entropy/ 2 farms with 3 sheep in 3 plots each.

This is why systems tend to move towards equilibrium over time. Example with 200 sheep and 300 plots [[CHART]]{.chart} We learned that the entropy of our universe keeps rising, and this is because higher entropy states are more probable than lower entropy ones . Based on this, we can extrapolate that our universe must have started off in a very improbable state of very low entropy. Maxwell's daemon: Only by knowing which particles are moving fast vs. slow a daemon could separate cold from hot molecules, thereby creating order from disorder only by using information and no energy. But it turns out that the daemon needs to store the information and in order to delete the information (if the storage runs out of space) it will take energy to do so. Calculus Rates of change and their accumulation over time Velocity = x/t = slope of line One could look at short parts of the line and approximate those as straight lines and measure their slopes. Limit = infinitely zooming in Can also be imagined by using discrete time steps: Integral = opposite e.g. measure position based on velocity per time: Measure the area under the curve Relativity https://www.youtube.com/watch?v= Special relativity = E=mc^2^ Gravity = curvature of space-time More gravity = slower time -> clocks on mountains tick faster Approaching the speed of light , a person inside a spaceship would age much slower than his twin at home. Even at the \\\"low speed \\\" of 10% of the speed of light (300,000 km per second, or 186,300 miles per second) our clocks would slow down by only around 1%, but if we travel at 95% of the speed of light time will slow down to about one-third of that measured by a stationary observer. The satellite clocks are moving at 14,000 km/hr in orbits that circle the Earth twice per day, much faster than clocks on the surface of the Earth, and Einstein\\'s theory of special relativity says that rapidly moving clocks tick more slowly, by about seven microseconds (millionths of a second) per day. Also, the orbiting clocks are 20,000 km above the Earth, and experience gravity that is four times weaker than that on the ground. Einstein\\'s general relativity theory says that gravity curves space and time, resulting in a tendency for the orbiting clocks to tick slightly faster, by about 45 microseconds per day. The net result is that time on a GPS satellite clock advances faster than a clock on the ground by about 38 microseconds per day. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFV2feKDK9E https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFV2feKDK9E Additive and subtractive property of speed If A throws a ball to B while B is running towards A the speed of the B (W) is added to the speed of the ball V A B W V+W If A throws a ball to B while B is running away from A the speed of the B (W) is subtracted from the speed of the ball V A B W V-W Since the speed of light is constant the equivalent formulas need to be adjusted considering special relativity: V+W = $\\frac{v + w}{1 + vw \\slash C^{2}}$ if V = speed of light C+W = $\\frac{c + w}{1 + cw \\slash C^{2}}$ = c https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28c%2Bw%29%2F%281%2Bcw%2Fc%5E2%29 V-W = = $\\frac{v - w}{1 - vw \\slash C^{2}}$ Treaty ceremony two presidents only want to sign a treaty at the same time. Therefore it has been decided that they sign only if the light from a light bulb that sits on a table that they sit the same distance away from reaches their eye while sitting in a train. For observers that stand outside the train (while it's moving), the light does not reach the eyes of the presidents at the same time since the movement of the train moves towards the president on the left hand-side (train is moving from left to right). Time difference (from perspective of platform): L = Length of train V = speed of train F = president forward land B = president backward land t~F~= time it takes the light to reach F t~B~= time it takes the light to reach B Distance travelled for B = L/2 + V t~B~ Distance travelled for F = L/2 - V t~F~ c t~B~= L/2 + V t~B\\ =~ L/2 (C-V) c t~F~ = L/2 (C+V) Time difference = $\\frac{\\text{VL}}{C^{2 -}V^{2}}$ Information theory Shannon: information content is biggest for inprobable outcomes. The basic intuition behind information theory is that learning that an unlikely event has occurred is more informative than learning that a likely event has occurred. Let's say there is a 75% chance that Nazis will surrender and a 25% chance that they won't. How much information does the event 'surrender' have? log (1/0.75) = log(1.333) = 0.41 (log base 2 omitted going forward) How much information does the event 'not surrender' have? log (1/0.25) = log(4) = 2 Thus, the information in EVERY possible news is 0.25 * log(4) + 0.75 * log(1.333)= 0.81 Info Don\\'t surrender 0.42 =LOG(1/0.75,2) Don\\'t surrender 0.42 =LOG(1/0.75,2) Don\\'t surrender 0.42 =LOG(1/0.75,2) Surrender 2.00 =LOG(1/0.25,2) 3.25 =SUM(B2:B5) 3.25 0.81 =C7*4 =0.25*B5+0.75*B2 Suppose a variable can take on 3 different values a,b,c with the following probabilites Value Probability Bit representation # Bits Entropy a 50% 2/4 0 1 .5 b 25% 1/4 10 2 .5 C 25% 1/4 11 2 .5 1.5 This is Huffman Coding. When the first bit is a 0, the receiver knows to stop reading that \"word\" right there; when the first bit is a 1, the readers knows to also read the next bit to complete the \"word\". With the above representation, what is the number of bits needed to represent this variable?! Well, we need just 1 bit half the time (when the value taken on is \\'a\\'), and 2 bits each the other 2 times When p(x==c)=1/4 (i.e., p(c)), the numerator 1 and denominator 4 say that the value \\'c\\' is taken on once in 4 times, which means there might be up to 3 other values that the variable can take on at other times (i.e., when it does not take on the value c). In which case, there are 4 values altogether and we will need the following number of bits to represent them all: log~2~ (1/p) bits = 2 bits For 'a', we can interpret p(a) = 2/4 as the value 'a' being taken on twice in four times. Or, we can now say that of the 4 values the variable can take on, two are 'a's, one is 'b', and one is 'c'.

We love someone when the importance of his or her needs and desires rises to the level of our own. The point is that love is demonstrated behaviorally. It is difficult to remove by logic an idea not placed there by logic in the first place If most of our behavior is driven by our feelings, however unclear they may be, it follows that to change ourselves we must be able to identify our emotional needs and find ways of satisfying them that do not offend those upon whom our happiness depends. If we wish, as most of us do, to be treated with kindness and forbearance, we need to cultivate those qualities in ourselves. Any relationship is under the control of the person who cares the least The perfect is the enemy of the good. The problem with perfectionists and their preoccupation with control is that the qualities that make them effective in their work can render them insufferable in their personal lives. I treat a lot of engineers and accountants and computer programmers. To be less controlling in their jobs would render them ineffective. The best one can hope for is to introduce them to the paradox of perfection: in some settings, notably in our intimate relationships, we gain control only by relinquishing it. Life's two most important questions are \"Why?\" and \"Why not?\" The trick is knowing which one to ask. To take the risks necessary to achieve this goal (find love) is an act of courage. To refuse to take them, to protect our hearts against all loss, is an act of despair. Our greatest strengths are our greatest weaknesses. One theme that is played out in many marriages is the coming together of someone with strong obsessive characteristics (usually a man) with someone else who has a more impulsive and theatrical personality (usually a woman). These people are initially drawn to each other because of complementary needs. The man is in need of more entertainment in his life and he values the woman as less inhibited, more spontaneous than he. The woman sees the well-organized and meticulous man as promising a measure of restraint that will balance her impulsive tendencies.

The statement \"any equation of the form Ax + By = C\" technically means \"any equation of the form Ax + By = C or equivalent to the form.\" For example, the equation y = x + 3, which has a straight line graph, is equivalent to - x + y = 3. The knowledge that any equation of the form Ax + By = C produces a straight line graph, along with the fact that two points determine a straight line, makes graphing linear equations in two variables a simple process. We merely find two solutions, plot the corresponding points, and connect the points with a straight line. It is probably wise to find a third point as a check point. Point slope form M=slope Systems of equations: 9x -- 4y= -78 4x + y = -18 When drawing both equations as a graph the solution of both equations would be the intersection of those lines since it represents a point that satisfies both equations.

The ordered pair (6, 1), which is associated with the point of intersection of the two lines, satisfies both equations. In other words, we say that (6, 1) is the solution for x - 2y = 4 and x + 2y = 8. To solve a system of linear equations by graphing, we proceed as in the opening discussion of this section. We graph the equations on the same set of axes, and then the ordered pairs associated with any points of intersection are the solutions to the system.

The number i is an imaginary number, and anything multiplied by i is also an imaginary number. $2^{10} 2^{5\\ } = 2^{15}$ $\\left( 2 9 \\right)^{100} = 2^{100}*9^{100}$ ------------------------------ $\\frac{2^{12}}{2^{5}} = \\ 2^{7}$ $4^{- 3} = \\frac{1}{64}$ a number with a negative exponent is just the reciprocal of the number to the positive exponent $$a^{m}a^{n} = a^{(m + n\\ )}$$ ------------------------------- $2^{10{}^{5}} = 2^{10 5}$ $2^{105} 2^{- 100} = 2^{5}$ --------------------------------- $4^{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\ \\sqrt{4} = 2$ $27^{\\frac{1}{3}} = \\sqrt[3]{27 = 3}$ Negative exponent means take the reciprocal of the base to the positive exponent ${\\frac{\\mathbf{1}}{\\mathbf{a}^{\\mathbf{n}}}\\mathbf{=}\\mathbf{a}^{\\mathbf{- n}}\\mathbf{\\text{\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ }}\\frac{\\mathbf{a}^{\\mathbf{m}}}{\\mathbf{a}^{\\mathbf{n}}}\\mathbf{=}\\mathbf{a}^{\\mathbf{m - n}}\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ 16}^{- \\frac{1}{2}} = {(\\frac{1}{16})}^{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{1^{\\frac{1}{2}}}{16^{\\frac{1}{2}}} = \\frac{1}{4}$ ${(\\frac{2}{3})}^{- 3} = ({\\frac{3}{2})}^{3} = \\frac{27}{8}$ ------------------------------- ${- 4}^{- 3} = - \\frac{1}{4^{3}}^{} = - \\frac{1}{64}$ ${- 4}^{3} = - 64\\ \\ \\ \\ {- 4}^{2} = 1$6","title":"Exponent rules:"},{"location":"Math/Math/#radicals-squareroot-with-non-negatives","text":"$$\\sqrt{36} = 6;\\ \\sqrt{72} = \\sqrt{36 2} = {(36 2)}^{\\frac{1}{2}} = 36^{\\frac{1}{2}} 2^{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\sqrt{36} \\sqrt{2} = 6*\\sqrt{2}$$","title":"Radicals= squareroot with non negatives:"},{"location":"Math/Math/#logarithms-inverse-of-taking-the-exponent-of-something","text":"$2^{3} = 8;\\ \\log_{2}8 = 3$ (log2 8= 2 to what power is equal to 8 ) $\\mathbf{\\log}_{\\mathbf{2}}\\mathbf{8}\\mathbf{= x;}\\mathbf{2}^{\\mathbf{x}}\\mathbf{= 8}$ $\\log_{4}64 = 3\\ because\\ 4^{3} = 64$ (log base 4 of 64 $$\\log_{x}27 = 3;\\ x^{3} = 27;3$$ If the base of a log is positive the number needs to be larger than 0 $\\text{\\ \\ \\ \\ }\\mathbf{\\ }\\mathbf{\\log}_{\\mathbf{3}}\\mathbf{- 1}$ =undefined Logarithm properties: $$a^{b} = c;\\ \\log_{a}{c = b}$$ $\\log_{B}{A + \\log_{B}{C = \\log_{B}{A*C}}}$ $\\log_{B}A - \\ \\log_{B}{C = \\log_{B}{A/C}}$ $A*\\log_{B}{C = \\log_{B}C^{A}}$ $$\\mathbf{\\log} {\\mathbf{B}}{\\mathbf{A =}\\frac{\\mathbf{\\log} {\\mathbf{C}}\\mathbf{A}}{\\mathbf{\\log} {\\mathbf{C}}\\mathbf{B}}\\mathbf{\\text{\\ \\ \\ }}\\mathbf{\\log} {\\mathbf{17}}{\\mathbf{357 =}\\frac{\\mathbf{\\log} {\\mathbf{10}}\\mathbf{357}}{\\mathbf{\\log} {\\mathbf{10}}\\mathbf{17}}\\mathbf{\\text{\\ there\\ is\\ no\\ log}}\\mathbf{17\\ option\\ on\\ calculator}}}$$","title":"Logarithms: (inverse of taking the exponent of something)"},{"location":"Math/Math/#line-equation","text":"The slope of a line is the ratio of the vertical change to the horizontal change as we move from one point on a line to another point.

The statement \"any equation of the form Ax + By = C\" technically means \"any equation of the form Ax + By = C or equivalent to the form.\" For example, the equation y = x + 3, which has a straight line graph, is equivalent to - x + y = 3. The knowledge that any equation of the form Ax + By = C produces a straight line graph, along with the fact that two points determine a straight line, makes graphing linear equations in two variables a simple process. We merely find two solutions, plot the corresponding points, and connect the points with a straight line. It is probably wise to find a third point as a check point. Point slope form M=slope Systems of equations: 9x -- 4y= -78 4x + y = -18 When drawing both equations as a graph the solution of both equations would be the intersection of those lines since it represents a point that satisfies both equations.

The ordered pair (6, 1), which is associated with the point of intersection of the two lines, satisfies both equations. In other words, we say that (6, 1) is the solution for x - 2y = 4 and x + 2y = 8. To solve a system of linear equations by graphing, we proceed as in the opening discussion of this section. We graph the equations on the same set of axes, and then the ordered pairs associated with any points of intersection are the solutions to the system.","title":"Line equation:"},{"location":"Math/Math/#exponents-and-polynomials","text":"FOIL (First -- Outside -- Inside -- Last) Combination problems","title":"Exponents and Polynomials"},{"location":"Math/Math/#scientific-notation","text":"","title":"Scientific notation:"},{"location":"Math/Math/#factoring","text":"Find the greatest common factor","title":"Factoring"},{"location":"Math/Math/#summary-elementary-algebra","text":"","title":"Summary elementary algebra"},{"location":"Math/Math/#fractions","text":"","title":"Fractions"},{"location":"Math/Probability/","text":"https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:HarvardX+FC1x+1T2020/ (HarvardX FC1xFat Chance: Probability from the Ground Up) Sequence = permutation = order matters (1-2 \\<> 2-1) (choosing president, vice-president, chair) Collections = combinations = order does not matter (1-2 = 2-1) (choosing a committee) Counting sequences (ordered) or permutations How many numbers are in 1..10? 1..n = n How many numbers are in 5..56?

Suppose we have some evidence that leads to a hypothesis . Five minutes pass and we then acquire new evidence that needs to be accounted for in our previous hypothesis. How do we update our hypothesis? Let H denote our hypothesis and E denote our evidence. Bayes' Theorem is defined by It's saying what is the probability that my hypothesis is true given the evidence we have. In order to answer these questions, we need three things: the probability the hypothesis is true \u2119(H) also called prior if not known or random we can assume .5 the probability of the evidence given that the hypothesis is true \u2119(E|H) also called the likelihood and the probability of the evidence \u2119(E)also called the normalizing constant The result is called posterior D is in this case for data same as E in the other formula P(E) = P(H) * p(E|H) P(breast cancer|test positive) = p(breast cancer) * p(test positive|breast cancer)/p(test positive) = .01 * .9 / (.01 * .9 + .99 * .09) P(cancer|test positive) = 8/(8+95) http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkbayes/thinkbayes.pdf https://mybinder.org/repo/rlabbe/ThinkBayes Cookie problem There are two bowls of cookies: Bowl 1: 30 vanilla and 10 chocolate cookies Bowl 2: 20 vanilla and 20 chocolate cookies Now suppose you choose one of the bowls at random and, without looking, select a cookie at random.

The prizes are arranged at random. The object of the game is to guess which door has the car. If you guess right, you get to keep the car. You pick a door, which we will call Door A. We'll call the other doors B and C. Before opening the door you chose, Monty increases the suspense by opening either Door B or C, whichever does not have the car. (If the car is actually behind Door A, Monty can safely open B or C, so he chooses one at random.) . We'll assume he opens Door B. Then Monty offers you the option to stick with your original choice or switch to the one remaining unopened door. The question is, should you stick or switch or does it make no difference? Better switch p(E) = Door B opened (and there is no car behind B) p(car is behind Door A or C | Monty opened Door B) Car is behind door x Prior p(car behind door x) Likelihood p(Door B opened | car behind door x) Prior * Likelihood Prior / (sum previous column) A 1/3 1/2 1/6 1/6 / .5 = 1/3 B 1/3 0 0 0 C 1/3 1 2/6 2/6 / .5 = 2/3 Likelihood: If the car is actually behind A, Monty could safely open Doors B or C. So the probability that he chooses B is 1/2. And since the car is actually behind A, the probability that the car is not behind B is 1. Choose 1 = 1/3 chance of winning Remaining chance = 2/3 Of that 2/3 chance one door will be eliminated therefore it's better to switch Odds To convert from a probability to odds , divide the probability by one minus that probability . So if the probability is 10% or 0.10 , then the odds are 0.1/0.9 or \\'1 to 9\\' or 0.111. To convert from odds to a probability , divide the odds by one plus the odds .

The cookie is vanilla. The prior probability p(bowl 1) is 50%, so the prior odds are 1 : 1, or just 1. The likelihoods for vanilla in each bowl are: Bowl1 30 : 10 = 30/40 or \u00be Bowl2 : 20: 20= 20/40 or \u00bd Likelihood ratio = \u00be / \u00bd = 3/2 Posterior odds = 3 : 2 = 3/5 in probability (60%) Pigeon hole principle The pigeonhole principle states that If n + 1 objects are placed into n boxes, then some box contains at least 2 objects. For example, if there are 5 people living in your house, but you only have 4 bedrooms, then at least 2 people must share a bedroom. The Irish Hair puzzle is a well-known illustration of the pigeonhole principle. The population of Ireland is approximately 4.6 million however, the average number of hairs on the human head is only 150,000. By the pigeonhole principle, there must be at least two people in Ireland with the same number of hairs on their head. In other words, even if there were 150,000 people, each with a different number of hairs on their head, the rest of the population must fit into one of the categories between 0 and 150,000 hairs. Birthday paradox What is the chance in a room with 23 people that two people share a birthday? # of pairs that can be build = 23*22/2 = 253 23!/(21! * 2!) chance for two people having the same birthday = 1/365 chance for two people not having the same birthday = 1- 1/365 = 364/365 in 364 out of 365 scenarios there won't be a match. Chance of 253 unique pairs = (364/365)\\^253 Number of pairs 253 = (23 * 22)/2 Chance of a unique pair 99.7260% = 364/365 Chance of 253 unique pairs 49.95% = (99.7260%)\\^253 Chance of some match 50.05% = 1 - 49.95% Can also be calculated as = 1- Permut(365,23)/(365 \\^ 23) Problem 6. There are n people present in a room. Prove that among them there are two people who have the same number of people they know in the room. Solution. Each person may have between 0 and n \u2212 1 acquaintances (inclusive). We imagine labelling each person with the number of acquaintances that person has. We have n people, and n possible values for the labels. We would like to show that some two people have the same label value. If there were more people than label values, we would be \ufb01nished. But since there is the same number of label values as people, we appear to be stuck. However, observe that the only way that no two people have the same label value is that everyone has a di\ufb00erent label. Thus one person knows nobody, one person knows 1 person, and so on, and \ufb01nally one person knows n \u2212 1 people. But this last person then knows everyone else, and in particular this means that there cannot be a person who knows nobody. This contradiction shows that there must indeed be two people who have the same number of acquaintances in the room. 7. If you pick five cards from a standard deck of 52 cards, then at least two will be of the same suit. Each of the five cards can belong to one of four suits. By the pigeonhole principle, two or more must belong to the same suit. There is another version of the pigeonhole principle that comes in handy. This version is \"the maximum value is at least the average value, for any non-empty finite bag of real numbers\" (thanks Professor Dijkstra) Do not let the math jargon intimidate you. The idea is intuitive. For typical data sets, the average is the \"middle\" value, so clearly the maximum should be at least as big. While this version sounds different, it is mathematically the same as the one stated with pigeons and pigeonholes. Consider again the problem of stuffing pigeons into pigeonholes and consider the average. If we have more than n pigeons and n pigeonholes, then the average value of (pigeons / pigeonholes) is greater than one. This means the maximum value should also be larger than one.

Each person may have between 0 and n \u2212 1 acquaintances (inclusive). We imagine labelling each person with the number of acquaintances that person has. We have n people, and n possible values for the labels. We would like to show that some two people have the same label value. If there were more people than label values, we would be \ufb01nished. But since there is the same number of label values as people, we appear to be stuck. However, observe that the only way that no two people have the same label value is that everyone has a di\ufb00erent label. Thus one person knows nobody, one person knows 1 person, and so on, and \ufb01nally one person knows n \u2212 1 people. But this last person then knows everyone else, and in particular this means that there cannot be a person who knows nobody. This contradiction shows that there must indeed be two people who have the same number of acquaintances in the room. 7. If you pick five cards from a standard deck of 52 cards, then at least two will be of the same suit. Each of the five cards can belong to one of four suits. By the pigeonhole principle, two or more must belong to the same suit. There is another version of the pigeonhole principle that comes in handy. This version is \"the maximum value is at least the average value, for any non-empty finite bag of real numbers\" (thanks Professor Dijkstra) Do not let the math jargon intimidate you. The idea is intuitive. For typical data sets, the average is the \"middle\" value, so clearly the maximum should be at least as big. While this version sounds different, it is mathematically the same as the one stated with pigeons and pigeonholes. Consider again the problem of stuffing pigeons into pigeonholes and consider the average. If we have more than n pigeons and n pigeonholes, then the average value of (pigeons / pigeonholes) is greater than one. This means the maximum value should also be larger than one. In other words, there has to be some value of more than one pigeons per pigeonhole. Indeed, the two versions are about the same idea.","title":"Birthday paradox"},{"location":"Personal_Development/7_habits_of_highly_effective_people/","text":"THE SEVEN HABITS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE This new level of thinking is what Seven Habits of Highly Effective People is about. It\\'s a principle-centered, character-based, \\\"Inside-Out\\\" approach to personal and interpersonal effectiveness. \\\"Inside-Out\\\" means to start first with self; even more fundamentally, to start with the most inside part of self -- with your paradigms, your character, and your motives. It says if you want to have a happy marriage, be the kind of person who generates positive energy and sidesteps negative energy rather than empowering it. If you want to have a more pleasant, cooperative teenager, be a more understanding, empathic, consistent, loving parent. If you want to have more freedom, more latitude in your job, be a more responsible, a more helpful, a more contributing employee. If you want to be trusted, be trustworthy. If you want the secondary greatness of recognized talent, focus first on primary greatness of character. The Inside-Out approach says that Private Victories TM precede Public Victories TM, that making and keeping promises to ourselves precedes making and keeping promises to others. It says it is futile to put personality ahead of character, to try to improve relationships with others before improving ourselves. Inside-Out is a process -- a continuing process of renewal based on the natural laws that govern human growth and progress. It\\'s an upward spiral of growth that leads to progressively higher forms of responsible independence and effective interdependence. The character ethic taught that there are basic principles of effective living, and that people can only experience true success and enduring happiness as they learn and integrate these principles into their basic character. But shortly after World War I the basic view of success shifted from the character ethic to what we might call the personality ethic. Success became more a function of personality, of public image, of attitudes and behaviors, skills and techniques that lubricate the processes of human interaction. This personality ethic essentially took two paths: one was human and public relations techniques and the other was positive mental attitude (PMA). If I try to use human influence strategies and tactics of how to get other people to do what I want, to work better, to be more motivated, to like me and each other -- while my character is fundamentally flawed, marked by duplicity and insincerity -- then, in the long run, I cannot be successful. My duplicity will breed distrust, and everything I do -- even using so-called good human relations techniques -- will be perceived as manipulative. It simply makes no difference how good the rhetoric is or even how good the intentions are; if there is little or no trust, there is no foundation for permanent success. Only basic goodness gives life to technique. This brings into focus one of the basic flaws of the personality ethic. To try to change outward attitudes and behaviors does very little good in the long run if we fail to examine the basic paradigms from which those attitudes and behaviors flow. Each of us tends to think we see things as they are, that we are objective. But this is not the case. We see the world, not as it is, but as we are -- or, as we are conditioned to see it. When we open our mouths to describe what we see, we in effect describe ourselves, our perceptions, our paradigms. When other people disagree with us, we immediately think something is wrong with them. But, as the demonstration shows, sincere, clearheaded people see things differently, each looking through the unique lens of experience. The more aware we are of our basic paradigms, maps, or assumptions, and the extent to which we have been influenced by our experience, the more we can take responsibility for those paradigms, examine them, test them against reality, listen to others and be open to their perceptions, thereby getting a larger picture and a far more objective view. Paradigm Shift experienced by the captain -- and by us as we read this account -- puts the situation in a totally different light. We can see a reality that is superseded by his limited perceptions -- a reality that is as critical for us to understand in our daily lives as it was for the captain in the fog. Principles are guidelines for human conduct that are proven to have enduring, permanent value. They\\'re fundamental. They\\'re essentially unarguable because they are self-evident. One way to quickly grasp the self-evident nature of principles is to simply consider the absurdity of attempting to live an effective life based on their opposites. I doubt that anyone would seriously consider unfairness, deceit, baseness, uselessness, mediocrity, or degeneration to be a solid foundation for lasting happiness and success. Although people may argue about how these principles are defined or manifested or achieved, there seems to be an innate consciousness and awareness that they exist. The more closely our maps or paradigms are aligned with these principles or natural laws, the more accurate and functional they will be. Correct maps will infinitely impact our personal and interpersonal effectiveness far more than any amount of effort expended on changing our attitudes and behaviors. The glitter of the personality ethic, the massive appeal, is that there is some quick and easy way to achieve quality of life -- personal effectiveness and rich, deep relationships with other people -- without going through the natural process of work and growth that makes it possible Our level of development is fairly obvious with tennis or piano playing, where it is impossible to pretend. But it is not so obvious in the areas of character and emotional development. We can \\\"pose\\\" and \\\"put on\\\" for a stranger or an associate. We can pretend. And for a while we can get by with it -- at least in public. We might even deceive ourselves. Yet I believe that most of us know the truth of what we really are inside; and I think many of those we live with and work with do as well. I have seen the consequences of attempting to shortcut this natural process of growth often in the business world, where executives attempt to \\\"buy\\\" a new culture of improved productivity, quality, morale, and customer service with the strong speeches, smile training, and external interventions, or through mergers, acquisitions, and friendly or unfriendly takeovers. But they ignore the low-trust climate produced by such manipulations. When these methods don\\'t work, they look for other personality ethic techniques that will -- all the time ignoring and violating the natural principles and processes on which high-trust culture is based. Habits are powerful factors in our lives. Because they are consistent, often unconscious patterns, they constantly, daily, express our character and produce our effectiveness or ineffectiveness. For our purposes, we will define a habit as the intersection of knowledge, skill, and desire. Knowledge is the theoretical paradigm, the what to do and the why. Skill is the how to do. And desire is the motivation, the want to do. In order to make something a habit in our lives, we have to have all three. But knowing I need to listen and knowing how to listen is not enough. Unless I want to listen, unless I have the desire, it won\\'t be a habit in my life. Creating a habit requires work in all three dimensions. The Seven Habits are not a set of separate or piecemeal psyche-up formulas. In harmony with the natural laws of growth, they provide an incremental, sequential, highly integrated approach to the development of personal and interpersonal effectiveness. They move us progressively on a Maturity Continuum from dependence to interdependence. As we continue to grow and mature, we become increasingly aware that all of nature is interdependent, that there is an ecological system that governs nature, including society. We further discover that the higher reaches of our nature have to do with our relationships with others -- that human life also is interdependent. Dependent people need others to get what they want. Independent people can get what they want through their own effort. Interdependent people combine their own efforts with the efforts of others to achieve their greatest success. Interdependence is a far more mature, more advanced concept. If I am physically interdependent, I am self-reliant and capable, but I also realize that you and I working together can accomplish far more than, even at my best, I could accomplish alone. If I am emotionally interdependent, I derive a great sense of worth within myself, but I also recognize the need for love, for giving, and for receiving love from others. If I am intellectually interdependent, I realize that I need the best thinking of other people to join with my own. As an interdependent person, I have the opportunity to share myself deeply, meaningfully, with others, and I have access to the vast resources and potential of other human beings. Interdependence is a choice only independent people can make. Dependent people cannot choose to become interdependent. They don\\'t have the character to do it; they don\\'t own enough of themselves. That\\'s why Habits 1, 2, and 3 in the following chapters deal with self-mastery. They move a person from dependence to independence. They are the \\\"Private Victories,\\\" the essence of character growth. Private Victories precede Public Victories. You can\\'t invert that process anymore than you can harvest a crop before you plant it. It\\'s Inside-Out. The habits The Seven Habits are habits of effectiveness. Because they are based on principles, they bring the maximum long-term beneficial results possible. They become the basis of a person\\'s character, creating an empowering center of correct maps from which an individual can effectively solve problems, maximize opportunities, and continually learn and integrate other principles in an upward spiral of growth. They are also habits of effectiveness because they are based on a paradigm of effectiveness that is in harmony with a natural law, a principle I call the \\\"P/PC Balance,\\\" which many people break themselves against. This principle can be easily understood by remembering Aesop\\'s fable of the Goose and the Golden Egg As the story shows, true effectiveness is a function of two things: what is produced (the golden eggs) and the producing asset or capacity to produce (the goose). Effectiveness lies in the balance -- what I call the P/PC Balance TM. P stands for production of desired results, the golden eggs. PC stands for production capability, the ability or asset that produces the golden eggs. In our quest for short-term returns, or results, we often ruin a prized physical asset -- a car, a computer, a washer or dryer, even our body or our environment. Keeping P and PC in balance makes a tremendous difference in the effective use of physical assets. To maintain the P/PC Balance, the balance between the golden egg (Production) and the health and welfare of the goose (Production Capability) is often a difficult judgment call. But I suggest it is the very essence of effectiveness. It balances short term with long term. It balances going for the grade and paying the price to get an education. It balances the desire to have a room clean and the building of a relationship in which the child is internally committed to do it -- cheerfully, willingly, without external supervision. Private Victory Habit 1: Be Proactive -- Principles of Personal Vision Between stimulus and response is our greatest power -- the freedom to choose. Within the freedom to choose are those endowments that make us uniquely human. In addition to self-awareness, we have imagination -- the ability to create in our minds beyond our present reality. We have conscience -- a deep inner awareness of right and wrong, of the principles that govern our behavior, and a sense of the degree to which our thoughts and actions are in harmony with them. And we have independent will -- the ability to act based on our self-awareness, free of all other influences. Proactivity defined It means that as human beings, we are responsible for our own lives. Our behavior is a function of our decisions, not our conditions. We can subordinate feelings to values. We have the initiative and the responsibility to make things happen. Look at the word responsibility -- \\\"response-ability\\\" -- the ability to choose your response. Highly proactive people recognize that responsibility. They do not blame circumstances, conditions, or conditioning for their behavior. Their behavior is a product of their own conscious choice, based on values, rather than a product of their conditions, based on feeling. Proactive people can carry their own weather with them. Whether it rains or shines makes no difference to them. They are value driven; and if their value is to produce good quality work, it isn\\'t a function of whether the weather is conducive to it or not. The ability to subordinate an impulse to a value is the essence of the proactive person. Reactive people are driven by feelings, by circumstances, by conditions, by their environment. Proactive people are driven by values -- carefully thought about, selected and internalized values. Proactive people are still influenced by external stimuli, whether physical, social, or psychological. But their response to the stimuli, conscious or unconscious, is a value-based choice or response. As Eleanor Roosevelt observed, \\\"No one can hurt you without your consent.\\\" In the words of Gandhi, \\\"They cannot take away our self-respect if we do not give it to them.\\\" It is our willing permission, our consent to what happens to us, that hurts us far more than what happens to us in the first place. Whether a problem is direct, indirect, or no control, we have in our hands the first step to the solution. Changing our habits, changing our methods of influence and changing the way we see our no control problems are all within our Circle of Influence. Anytime we think the problem is \\\"out there,\\\" that thought is the problem. We empower what\\'s out there to control us. The change paradigm is \\\"outside-in\\\" -- what\\'s out there has to change before we can change. The proactive approach is to change from the Inside-Out: to be different, and by being different, to effect positive change in what\\'s out there -- I can be more resourceful, I can be more diligent, I can be more creative, I can be more cooperative. While we are free to choose our actions, we are not free to choose the consequences of those actions. Consequences are governed by natural law. They are out in the Circle of Concern. We can decide to step in front of a fast-moving train, but we cannot decide what will happen when the train hits us. We can decide to be dishonest in our business dealings. While the social consequences of that decision may vary depending on whether or not we are found out, the natural consequences to our basic character are a fixed result. Our behavior is governed by principles. Living in harmony with them brings positive consequences; violating them brings negative consequences. We are free to choose our response in any situation, but in doing so, we choose the attendant consequence. \\\"When we pick up one end of the stick, we pick up the other.\\\" For those filled with regret, perhaps the most needful exercise of proactivity is to realize that past mistakes are also out there in the Circle of Concern. We can\\'t recall them, we can\\'t undo them, and we can\\'t control the consequences that came as a result. We can make a promise -- and keep it. Or we can set a goal -- and work to achieve it. As we make and keep commitments, even small commitments, we begin to establish an inner integrity that gives us the awareness of self-control and the courage and strength to accept more of the responsibility for our own lives. By making and keeping promises to ourselves and others, little by little, our honor becomes greater than our moods. The power to make and keep commitments to ourselves is the essence of developing the basic habits of effectiveness. Knowledge, skill, and desire are all within our control. We can work on any one to improve the balance of the three. As the area of intersection becomes larger, we more deeply internalize the principles upon which the habits are based and create the strength of character to move us in a balanced way toward increasing effectiveness in our lives. Habit 2: Begin with the End in Mind The application of \\\"Begin with the End in Mind\\\" is to begin today with the image, picture, or paradigm of the end of your life as your frame of reference or the criterion by which everything else is examined. Each part of your life -- today\\'s behavior, tomorrow\\'s behavior, next week\\'s behavior, and next month\\'s behavior -- can be examined in the context of the whole, of what really matters most to you. By keeping that end clearly in mind, you can make certain that whatever you do on any particular day does not violate the criteria you have defined as supremely important, and that each day of your life contributes in a meaningful way to the vision you have of your life as a whole. It\\'s incredibly easy to get caught up in an activity trap, in the busy-ness of life, to work harder and harder at climbing the ladder of success only to discover it\\'s leaning against the wrong wall. If the ladder is not leaning against the right wall, every step we take just gets us to the wrong place faster. \\\"Begin with the End in Mind\\\" is based on the principle that all things are created twice. There\\'s a mental or first creation, and a physical or second creation to all things. To the extent to which we understand the principle of two creations and accept the responsibility for both, we act within and enlarge the borders of our Circle of Influence. To the extent to which we do not operate in harmony with this principle and take charge of the first creation, we diminish it. It\\'s a principle that all things are created twice, but not all first creations are by conscious design. In our personal lives, if we do not develop our own self-awareness and become responsible for first creations, we empower other people and circumstances outside our Circle or Influence to shape much of our lives by default. We reactively live the scripts handed to us by family, associates, other people\\'s agendas, the pressures of circumstance -- scripts from our earlier years, from our training, our conditioning These scripts come from people, not principles. And they rise out of our deep vulnerabilities, our deep dependency on others and our need for acceptance and love, for belonging, for a sense of importance and worth, for a feeling that we matter. Personal mission statement People can\\'t live with change if there\\'s not a changeless core inside them. The key to the ability to change is a changeless sense of who you are, what you are about and what you value. With a mission statement, we can flow with changes. We don\\'t need prejudgments or prejudices. We don\\'t need to figure out everything else in life, to stereotype and categorize everything and everybody in order to accommodate reality In order to write a personal mission statement, we must begin at the very center of our Circle of Influence, that center comprised of our most basic our paradigms, the lens through which we see the world. It is here that we deal with our vision and our values. It is here that we use our endowment of self-awareness to examine our maps and, if we value correct principles, to make certain that our maps accurately describe the territory, that our paradigms are based on principles and reality. It is here that we use our endowment of conscience as a compass to help us detect our own unique talents and areas of contribution. It is here that we use our endowment of imagination to mentally create the end we desire, giving direction and purpose to our beginnings and providing the substance of a written personal constitution. Whatever is at the center of our life will be the source of our security, guidance, wisdom, and power. Security represents your sense of worth, your identity, your emotional anchorage, your self-esteem, your basic personal strength or lack of it. Guidance means your source of direction in life. Encompassed by your map, your internal frame of reference that interprets for you what is happening out there, are standards or principles or implicit criteria that govern moment-by-moment decision-making and doing. These four factors -- security, guidance, wisdom, and power -- are interdependent. Security and clear guidance bring true wisdom, and wisdom becomes the spark or catalyst to release and direct power. When these four factors are present together, harmonized and enlivened by each other, they create the great force of a noble personality, a balanced character, a beautifully integrated individual. Principles don\\'t react to anything. They won\\'t divorce us or run away with our best friend. They aren\\'t out to get us. They can\\'t pave our way with shortcuts and quick fixes. They don\\'t depend on the behavior of others, the environment, or the current fad for their validity. Principles don\\'t die. They aren\\'t here one day and gone the next. They can\\'t be destroyed by fire, earthquake, or theft. Principles are deep, fundamental truths, classic truths, and generic common denominators. They are tightly interwoven threads running with exactness, consistency, beauty, and strength through the fabric of life. The wisdom and guidance that accompany Principle-Centered Living come from correct maps, from the way things really are, have been, and will be. Correct maps enable us to clearly see where we want to go and how to get there. We can make our decisions using the correct data that will make their implementation possible and meaningful. The personal power that comes from Principle-Centered Living is the power of a self-aware, knowledgeable, proactive individual, unrestricted by the attitudes, behaviors, and actions of others or by many of the circumstances and environmental influences that limit other people. Frankl says we detect rather than invent our missions in life. I like that choice of words. I think each of us has an internal monitor or sense, a conscience that gives us an awareness of our own uniqueness and the singular contributions that we can make. In Frankl\\'s words, \\\"Everyone has his own specific vocation or mission in life. Therein he cannot be replaced, nor can his life be repeated. Thus, everyone\\'s task is as unique as is his specific opportunity to implement it. A mission statement is not something you write overnight. It takes deep introspection, careful analysis, thoughtful expression, and often many rewrites to produce it in final form. It may take you several weeks or even months before you feel really comfortable with it, before you feel it is a complete and concise expression of your innermost values and directions. Even then, you will want to review it regularly and make minor changes as the years bring additional insights or changing circumstances. But fundamentally, your mission statement becomes your constitution, the solid expression of your vision and values. It becomes the criterion by which you measure everything else in your life. There are a number of techniques using your imagination that can put you in touch with your values. But the net effect of every one I have ever used is the same. When people seriously undertake to identify what really matters most to them in their lives, what they really want to be and to do, they become very reverent. They start to think in larger terms than today and tomorrow. In effective personal leadership, visualization and affirmation techniques emerge naturally out of a foundation of well thought through purposes and principles that become the center of a person\\'s life. They are extremely powerful in re-scripting and reprogramming, into writing deeply committed-to purposes and principles into one\\'s heart and mind. I believe that central to all enduring religions in society are the same principles and practices clothed in different language -- meditation, prayer, covenants, ordinances, scripture study, empathy, compassion, and many different forms of the use of both conscience and imagination. Habit 3: Put First Things First Habit 3, then, is the second creation -- the physical creation. It\\'s the fulfillment, the actualization, the natural emergence of Habits 1 and 2. It\\'s the exercise of independent will toward becoming principle-centered. It\\'s the day-in, day-out, moment-by-moment doing it. The key is not to prioritize what\\'s on your schedule, but to schedule your priorities. And this can best be done in the context of the week. Quadrant I -- Important and Urgent -- crises, deadline-driven projects, and pressing problems\\ Quadrant II -- Important and Not Urgent -- preparation, planning, and relationship building\\ Quadrant III -- Not Important and Urgent -- interruptions, most phone calls and mail and reports\\ Quadrant IV -- Not Important and Not Urgent -- trivia, busywork, time wasters, and escape activities Quadrant II organizing involves four key activities. Identifying Roles: The first task is to write down your key roles. If you haven\\'t really given serious thought to the roles in your life, you can write down what immediately comes to mind. You have a role as an individual. You may want to list one or more roles as a family member -- a husband or wife, mother or father, son or daughter, a member of the extended family of grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins. You may want to list a few roles in your work, indicating different areas in which you wish to invest time and energy on a regular basis. You may have roles in church or community affairs. You don\\'t need to worry about defining the roles in a way that you will live with for the rest of your life -- just consider the week and write down the areas you see yourself spending time in during the next seven days. e.g.: Individual Husband/Father Manager New Products Chairman United Way Personal Development Wife Mother Real Estate Salesperson Selecting Goals: The next step is to think of two or three important results you feel you should accomplish in each role during the next seven days. These would be recorded as goals. At least some of these goals should reflect Quadrant II activities. Ideally, these short-term goals would be tied to the longer-term goals you have identified in conjunction with your personal mission statement. But even if you haven\\'t written your mission statement, you can get a feeling, a sense, of what is important as you consider each of your roles and two or three goals for each role. Scheduling: Now you look at the week ahead with your goals in mind and schedule time to achieve them. For example, if your goal is to produce the first draft of your personal mission statement, you may want to set aside a two-hour block of time on Sunday to work on it. Sunday (or some other day of the week that is special to you, your faith, or your circumstances) is often the ideal time to plan your more personally uplifting activities, including weekly organizing. It\\'s a good time to draw back, to see inspiration, to look at your life in the context of principles and values. If you set a goal to become physically fit through exercise, you may want to set aside an hour three or four days during the week, or possibly every day during the week, to accomplish that goal. There are some goals that you may only be able to accomplish during business hours, or some that you can only do on Saturday when your children are home. Can you begin to see some of the advantages of organizing the week instead of the day? Daily Adapting: With Quadrant II weekly organizing, daily planning becomes more a function of daily adapting, or prioritizing activities and responding to unanticipated events, relationships, and experiences in a meaningful way. Taking a few minutes each morning to review your schedule can put you in touch with the value-based decisions you made as you organized the week as well as unanticipated factors that may have come up. As you overview the day, you can see that your roles and goals provide a natural prioritization that grows out of your innate sense of balance. It is a softer, more right-brain prioritization that ultimately comes out of your sense of personal mission. You simply can\\'t think efficiency with people. You think effectiveness with people and efficiency with things. I\\'ve tried to be \\\"efficient\\\" with a disagreeing or disagreeable person and it simply doesn\\'t work. I\\'ve tried to give 10 minutes of \\\"quality time\\\" to a child or an employee to solve a problem, only to discover such \\\"efficiency\\\" creates new problems and seldom resolves the deepest concern. Delegation Stewardship delegation involves clear, up-front mutual understanding and commitment regarding expectations in five areas. Desired Results: Create a clear, mutual understanding of what needs to be accomplished, focusing on what, not how; results, not methods. Spend time. Be patient. Visualize the desired result. Have the person see it, describe it, make out a quality statement of what the results will look like, and by when they will be accomplished. Guidelines: Identify the parameters within which the individual should operate. These should be as few as possible to avoid methods delegation, but should include any formidable restrictions. You won\\'t want a person to think he had considerable latitude as long as he accomplished the objectives, only to violate some long-standing traditional practice or value. That kills initiative and sends people back to the gofer\\'s creed: \\\"Just tell me what you want me to do, and I\\'ll do it.\\\" Let people learn from your mistakes or the mistakes of others. Point out the potential failure paths, what not to do, but don\\'t tell them what to do. Keep the responsibility for results with them -- to do whatever is necessary within the guidelines. Resources: Identify the human, financial, technical, or organizational resources the person can draw on to accomplish the desired results. Accountability: Set up the standards of performance that will be used in evaluating the results and the specific times when reporting and evaluation will take place. Consequences: Specify what will happen, both good and bad, as a result of the evaluation. This could include such things as financial rewards, psychic rewards, different job assignments, and natural consequences tied into the overall mission of an organization. Public Victory Integrity includes but goes beyond honesty. Honesty is telling the truth -- in other words, conforming our words to reality. Integrity is conforming reality to our words -- in other words, keeping promises and fulfilling expectations. This requires an integrated character, a oneness, primarily with self but also with life. One of the most important ways to manifest integrity is to be loyal to those who are not present. In doing so, we build the trust of those who are present. When you defend those who are absent, you retain the trust of those present. Habit 4: Think Win-Win -- Principles of Interpersonal Leadership Win-win is not a technique; it\\'s a total philosophy of human interaction. In fact, it is one of six paradigms of interaction. The alternative paradigms are win-lose, lose-win, lose-lose, win, and Win-Win or No Deal Win-win is a frame of mind and heart that constantly seeks mutual benefit in all human interactions. Win-win means that agreements or solutions are mutually beneficial, mutually satisfying. With a win-win solution, all parties feel good about the decision and feel committed to the action plan. Win-win sees life as a cooperative, not a competitive arena. Most people tend to think in terms of dichotomies: strong or weak, hardball or softball, win or lose. But that kind of thinking if fundamentally flawed. It\\'s based on power and position rather than on principle. Win-win is based on the paradigm that there is plenty for everybody, that one person\\'s success is not achieved at the expense or exclusion of the success of others. Win-win is a belief in the Third Alternative. It\\'s not your way or my way; it\\'s a better way, a higher way. No deal basically means that if we can\\'t find a solution that would benefit us both, we agree to disagree agreeably -- no deal. No expectations have been created, no performance contracts established. I don\\'t hire you or we don\\'t take on a particular assignment together because it\\'s obvious that our values or our goals are going in opposite directions. It is so much better to realize this up front instead of downstream when expectations have been created and both parties have been disillusioned. Anything less than win-win in an interdependent reality is a poor second best that will have impact in the long-term relationship. The cost of the impact needs to be carefully considered. If you can\\'t reach a true win-win, you\\'re very often better off to go for no deal. Win-Win or No Deal provides tremendous emotional freedom in the family relationship. If family members can\\'t agree on a video that everyone will enjoy, they can simply decide to do something else -- no deal -- rather than having some enjoy the evening at the expense of others. In my own work with various people and organizations seeking win-win solutions, I suggest that they become involved in the following four-step process: See the problem from the other point of view. Really seek to understand and give expression to the needs and concerns of the other party as well as or better than they can themselves. Identify the key issues and concerns (not positions) involved. Determine what results would constitute a fully acceptable solution. Identify possible new options to achieve those results. Habit 5: Seek First to Understand, Then to Be Understood Most people do not listen with the intent to understand; they listen with the intent to reply. They\\'re either speaking or preparing to speak. They\\'re filtering everything through their own paradigms, reading their autobiography into other people\\'s lives. \\\"Oh, I know exactly how you feel!\\\" \\\"I went through the very same thing. Let me tell you about my experience.\\\" They\\'re constantly projecting their own home movies onto other people\\'s behavior. They prescribe their own glasses for everyone with whom they interact. Emphatic listening When I say empathic listening, I am not referring to the techniques of \\\"active\\\" listening or \\\"reflective\\\" listening, which basically involve mimicking what another person says. That kind of listening is skill-based, truncated from character and relationship, and often insults those \\\"listened\\\" to in such a way. It is also essentially autobiographical. If you practice those techniques, you may not project your autobiography in the actual interaction, but your motive in listening is autobiographical. You listen with reflective skills, but you listen with intent to reply, to control, to manipulate. When I say empathic listening, I mean listening with intent to understand. I mean seeking first to understand, to really understand. It\\'s an entirely different paradigm. Empathic (from empathy) listening gets inside another person\\'s frame of reference. You look out through it, you see the world the way they see the world, you understand their paradigm, you understand how they feel. Empathy is not sympathy. Sympathy is a form of agreement, a form of judgment. And it is sometimes the more appropriate emotion and response. But people often feed on sympathy. It makes them dependent. The essence of empathic listening is not that you agree with someone; it\\'s that you fully, deeply, understand that person, emotionally as well as intellectually. In empathic listening, you listen with your ears, but you also, and more importantly, listen with your eyes and with your heart. You listen for feeling, for meaning. You listen for behavior. You use your right brain as well as your left. You sense, you intuit, you feel. Empathic listening is so powerful because it gives you accurate data to work with. Instead of projecting your own autobiography and assuming thought, feelings, motives, and interpretation, you\\'re dealing with the reality inside another person\\'s head and heart. You\\'re listening to understand. You\\'re focused on receiving the deep communication of another human soul. You will never be able to truly step inside another person, to see the world as he sees it, until you develop the pure desire, the strength of personal character, and the positive Emotional Bank Account, as well as the empathic listening skills to do it. Habit 6: Synergize When properly understood, synergy is the highest activity in all life -- the true test and manifestation of all the other habits put together. The highest forms of synergy focus the four unique human endowments, the motive of win-win, and the skills of empathic communication on the toughest challenges we face in life. What results is almost miraculous. We create new alternatives -- something that wasn\\'t there before. Habit 7: Sharpen the Saw - Principles of Balanced Self-Renewal Habit 7 is personal PC. It\\'s preserving and enhancing the greatest asset you have -- you. It\\'s renewing the four dimensions of your nature -- physical, spiritual, mental, and social/emotional. Although different words are used, most philosophies of life deal either explicitly or implicitly with these four dimensions. Philosopher Herb Shepherd describes the healthy balanced life around four values: perspective (spiritual), autonomy (mental), connectedness (social), and tone (physical). George Sheehan, the running guru, describes four roles: being a good animal (physical), a good craftsman (mental), a good friend (social), and a saint (spiritual). Sound motivation and organization theory embrace these four dimensions or motivations -- the economic (physical); how people are treated (social); how people are developed and used (mental); and the service, the job, the contribution the organization gives (spiritual). \\\"Sharpen the Saw\\\" basically means expressing all four motivations. It means exercising all four dimensions of our nature, regularly and consistently, in wise and balanced ways.","title":"7 habits of highly effective people"},{"location":"Personal_Development/7_habits_of_highly_effective_people/#the-seven-habits-of-highly-effective-people","text":"This new level of thinking is what Seven Habits of Highly Effective People is about. It\\'s a principle-centered, character-based, \\\"Inside-Out\\\" approach to personal and interpersonal effectiveness. \\\"Inside-Out\\\" means to start first with self; even more fundamentally, to start with the most inside part of self -- with your paradigms, your character, and your motives. It says if you want to have a happy marriage, be the kind of person who generates positive energy and sidesteps negative energy rather than empowering it. If you want to have a more pleasant, cooperative teenager, be a more understanding, empathic, consistent, loving parent. If you want to have more freedom, more latitude in your job, be a more responsible, a more helpful, a more contributing employee. If you want to be trusted, be trustworthy. If you want the secondary greatness of recognized talent, focus first on primary greatness of character. The Inside-Out approach says that Private Victories TM precede Public Victories TM, that making and keeping promises to ourselves precedes making and keeping promises to others. It says it is futile to put personality ahead of character, to try to improve relationships with others before improving ourselves. Inside-Out is a process -- a continuing process of renewal based on the natural laws that govern human growth and progress. It\\'s an upward spiral of growth that leads to progressively higher forms of responsible independence and effective interdependence. The character ethic taught that there are basic principles of effective living, and that people can only experience true success and enduring happiness as they learn and integrate these principles into their basic character. But shortly after World War I the basic view of success shifted from the character ethic to what we might call the personality ethic. Success became more a function of personality, of public image, of attitudes and behaviors, skills and techniques that lubricate the processes of human interaction. This personality ethic essentially took two paths: one was human and public relations techniques and the other was positive mental attitude (PMA). If I try to use human influence strategies and tactics of how to get other people to do what I want, to work better, to be more motivated, to like me and each other -- while my character is fundamentally flawed, marked by duplicity and insincerity -- then, in the long run, I cannot be successful. My duplicity will breed distrust, and everything I do -- even using so-called good human relations techniques -- will be perceived as manipulative. It simply makes no difference how good the rhetoric is or even how good the intentions are; if there is little or no trust, there is no foundation for permanent success. Only basic goodness gives life to technique. This brings into focus one of the basic flaws of the personality ethic. To try to change outward attitudes and behaviors does very little good in the long run if we fail to examine the basic paradigms from which those attitudes and behaviors flow. Each of us tends to think we see things as they are, that we are objective. But this is not the case. We see the world, not as it is, but as we are -- or, as we are conditioned to see it. When we open our mouths to describe what we see, we in effect describe ourselves, our perceptions, our paradigms. When other people disagree with us, we immediately think something is wrong with them. But, as the demonstration shows, sincere, clearheaded people see things differently, each looking through the unique lens of experience. The more aware we are of our basic paradigms, maps, or assumptions, and the extent to which we have been influenced by our experience, the more we can take responsibility for those paradigms, examine them, test them against reality, listen to others and be open to their perceptions, thereby getting a larger picture and a far more objective view. Paradigm Shift experienced by the captain -- and by us as we read this account -- puts the situation in a totally different light. We can see a reality that is superseded by his limited perceptions -- a reality that is as critical for us to understand in our daily lives as it was for the captain in the fog. Principles are guidelines for human conduct that are proven to have enduring, permanent value. They\\'re fundamental. They\\'re essentially unarguable because they are self-evident. One way to quickly grasp the self-evident nature of principles is to simply consider the absurdity of attempting to live an effective life based on their opposites. I doubt that anyone would seriously consider unfairness, deceit, baseness, uselessness, mediocrity, or degeneration to be a solid foundation for lasting happiness and success. Although people may argue about how these principles are defined or manifested or achieved, there seems to be an innate consciousness and awareness that they exist. The more closely our maps or paradigms are aligned with these principles or natural laws, the more accurate and functional they will be. Correct maps will infinitely impact our personal and interpersonal effectiveness far more than any amount of effort expended on changing our attitudes and behaviors. The glitter of the personality ethic, the massive appeal, is that there is some quick and easy way to achieve quality of life -- personal effectiveness and rich, deep relationships with other people -- without going through the natural process of work and growth that makes it possible Our level of development is fairly obvious with tennis or piano playing, where it is impossible to pretend. But it is not so obvious in the areas of character and emotional development. We can \\\"pose\\\" and \\\"put on\\\" for a stranger or an associate. We can pretend. And for a while we can get by with it -- at least in public. We might even deceive ourselves. Yet I believe that most of us know the truth of what we really are inside; and I think many of those we live with and work with do as well. I have seen the consequences of attempting to shortcut this natural process of growth often in the business world, where executives attempt to \\\"buy\\\" a new culture of improved productivity, quality, morale, and customer service with the strong speeches, smile training, and external interventions, or through mergers, acquisitions, and friendly or unfriendly takeovers. But they ignore the low-trust climate produced by such manipulations. When these methods don\\'t work, they look for other personality ethic techniques that will -- all the time ignoring and violating the natural principles and processes on which high-trust culture is based. Habits are powerful factors in our lives. Because they are consistent, often unconscious patterns, they constantly, daily, express our character and produce our effectiveness or ineffectiveness. For our purposes, we will define a habit as the intersection of knowledge, skill, and desire. Knowledge is the theoretical paradigm, the what to do and the why. Skill is the how to do. And desire is the motivation, the want to do. In order to make something a habit in our lives, we have to have all three. But knowing I need to listen and knowing how to listen is not enough. Unless I want to listen, unless I have the desire, it won\\'t be a habit in my life. Creating a habit requires work in all three dimensions. The Seven Habits are not a set of separate or piecemeal psyche-up formulas. In harmony with the natural laws of growth, they provide an incremental, sequential, highly integrated approach to the development of personal and interpersonal effectiveness. They move us progressively on a Maturity Continuum from dependence to interdependence. As we continue to grow and mature, we become increasingly aware that all of nature is interdependent, that there is an ecological system that governs nature, including society. We further discover that the higher reaches of our nature have to do with our relationships with others -- that human life also is interdependent. Dependent people need others to get what they want. Independent people can get what they want through their own effort. Interdependent people combine their own efforts with the efforts of others to achieve their greatest success. Interdependence is a far more mature, more advanced concept. If I am physically interdependent, I am self-reliant and capable, but I also realize that you and I working together can accomplish far more than, even at my best, I could accomplish alone. If I am emotionally interdependent, I derive a great sense of worth within myself, but I also recognize the need for love, for giving, and for receiving love from others. If I am intellectually interdependent, I realize that I need the best thinking of other people to join with my own. As an interdependent person, I have the opportunity to share myself deeply, meaningfully, with others, and I have access to the vast resources and potential of other human beings. Interdependence is a choice only independent people can make. Dependent people cannot choose to become interdependent. They don\\'t have the character to do it; they don\\'t own enough of themselves. That\\'s why Habits 1, 2, and 3 in the following chapters deal with self-mastery. They move a person from dependence to independence. They are the \\\"Private Victories,\\\" the essence of character growth. Private Victories precede Public Victories. You can\\'t invert that process anymore than you can harvest a crop before you plant it. It\\'s Inside-Out.","title":"THE SEVEN HABITS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE"},{"location":"Personal_Development/7_habits_of_highly_effective_people/#the-habits","text":"The Seven Habits are habits of effectiveness. Because they are based on principles, they bring the maximum long-term beneficial results possible. They become the basis of a person\\'s character, creating an empowering center of correct maps from which an individual can effectively solve problems, maximize opportunities, and continually learn and integrate other principles in an upward spiral of growth. They are also habits of effectiveness because they are based on a paradigm of effectiveness that is in harmony with a natural law, a principle I call the \\\"P/PC Balance,\\\" which many people break themselves against. This principle can be easily understood by remembering Aesop\\'s fable of the Goose and the Golden Egg As the story shows, true effectiveness is a function of two things: what is produced (the golden eggs) and the producing asset or capacity to produce (the goose). Effectiveness lies in the balance -- what I call the P/PC Balance TM. P stands for production of desired results, the golden eggs. PC stands for production capability, the ability or asset that produces the golden eggs. In our quest for short-term returns, or results, we often ruin a prized physical asset -- a car, a computer, a washer or dryer, even our body or our environment. Keeping P and PC in balance makes a tremendous difference in the effective use of physical assets. To maintain the P/PC Balance, the balance between the golden egg (Production) and the health and welfare of the goose (Production Capability) is often a difficult judgment call. But I suggest it is the very essence of effectiveness. It balances short term with long term. It balances going for the grade and paying the price to get an education. It balances the desire to have a room clean and the building of a relationship in which the child is internally committed to do it -- cheerfully, willingly, without external supervision.","title":"The habits"},{"location":"Personal_Development/7_habits_of_highly_effective_people/#private-victory","text":"","title":"Private Victory"},{"location":"Personal_Development/7_habits_of_highly_effective_people/#habit-1-be-proactive-principles-of-personal-vision","text":"Between stimulus and response is our greatest power -- the freedom to choose. Within the freedom to choose are those endowments that make us uniquely human. In addition to self-awareness, we have imagination -- the ability to create in our minds beyond our present reality. We have conscience -- a deep inner awareness of right and wrong, of the principles that govern our behavior, and a sense of the degree to which our thoughts and actions are in harmony with them. And we have independent will -- the ability to act based on our self-awareness, free of all other influences.","title":"Habit 1: Be Proactive -- Principles of Personal Vision"},{"location":"Personal_Development/7_habits_of_highly_effective_people/#proactivity-defined","text":"It means that as human beings, we are responsible for our own lives. Our behavior is a function of our decisions, not our conditions. We can subordinate feelings to values. We have the initiative and the responsibility to make things happen. Look at the word responsibility -- \\\"response-ability\\\" -- the ability to choose your response. Highly proactive people recognize that responsibility. They do not blame circumstances, conditions, or conditioning for their behavior. Their behavior is a product of their own conscious choice, based on values, rather than a product of their conditions, based on feeling. Proactive people can carry their own weather with them. Whether it rains or shines makes no difference to them. They are value driven; and if their value is to produce good quality work, it isn\\'t a function of whether the weather is conducive to it or not. The ability to subordinate an impulse to a value is the essence of the proactive person. Reactive people are driven by feelings, by circumstances, by conditions, by their environment. Proactive people are driven by values -- carefully thought about, selected and internalized values. Proactive people are still influenced by external stimuli, whether physical, social, or psychological. But their response to the stimuli, conscious or unconscious, is a value-based choice or response. As Eleanor Roosevelt observed, \\\"No one can hurt you without your consent.\\\" In the words of Gandhi, \\\"They cannot take away our self-respect if we do not give it to them.\\\" It is our willing permission, our consent to what happens to us, that hurts us far more than what happens to us in the first place. Whether a problem is direct, indirect, or no control, we have in our hands the first step to the solution. Changing our habits, changing our methods of influence and changing the way we see our no control problems are all within our Circle of Influence. Anytime we think the problem is \\\"out there,\\\" that thought is the problem. We empower what\\'s out there to control us. The change paradigm is \\\"outside-in\\\" -- what\\'s out there has to change before we can change. The proactive approach is to change from the Inside-Out: to be different, and by being different, to effect positive change in what\\'s out there -- I can be more resourceful, I can be more diligent, I can be more creative, I can be more cooperative. While we are free to choose our actions, we are not free to choose the consequences of those actions. Consequences are governed by natural law. They are out in the Circle of Concern. We can decide to step in front of a fast-moving train, but we cannot decide what will happen when the train hits us. We can decide to be dishonest in our business dealings. While the social consequences of that decision may vary depending on whether or not we are found out, the natural consequences to our basic character are a fixed result. Our behavior is governed by principles. Living in harmony with them brings positive consequences; violating them brings negative consequences. We are free to choose our response in any situation, but in doing so, we choose the attendant consequence. \\\"When we pick up one end of the stick, we pick up the other.\\\" For those filled with regret, perhaps the most needful exercise of proactivity is to realize that past mistakes are also out there in the Circle of Concern. We can\\'t recall them, we can\\'t undo them, and we can\\'t control the consequences that came as a result. We can make a promise -- and keep it. Or we can set a goal -- and work to achieve it. As we make and keep commitments, even small commitments, we begin to establish an inner integrity that gives us the awareness of self-control and the courage and strength to accept more of the responsibility for our own lives. By making and keeping promises to ourselves and others, little by little, our honor becomes greater than our moods. The power to make and keep commitments to ourselves is the essence of developing the basic habits of effectiveness. Knowledge, skill, and desire are all within our control. We can work on any one to improve the balance of the three. As the area of intersection becomes larger, we more deeply internalize the principles upon which the habits are based and create the strength of character to move us in a balanced way toward increasing effectiveness in our lives.","title":"Proactivity defined"},{"location":"Personal_Development/7_habits_of_highly_effective_people/#habit-2-begin-with-the-end-in-mind","text":"The application of \\\"Begin with the End in Mind\\\" is to begin today with the image, picture, or paradigm of the end of your life as your frame of reference or the criterion by which everything else is examined. Each part of your life -- today\\'s behavior, tomorrow\\'s behavior, next week\\'s behavior, and next month\\'s behavior -- can be examined in the context of the whole, of what really matters most to you. By keeping that end clearly in mind, you can make certain that whatever you do on any particular day does not violate the criteria you have defined as supremely important, and that each day of your life contributes in a meaningful way to the vision you have of your life as a whole. It\\'s incredibly easy to get caught up in an activity trap, in the busy-ness of life, to work harder and harder at climbing the ladder of success only to discover it\\'s leaning against the wrong wall. If the ladder is not leaning against the right wall, every step we take just gets us to the wrong place faster. \\\"Begin with the End in Mind\\\" is based on the principle that all things are created twice. There\\'s a mental or first creation, and a physical or second creation to all things. To the extent to which we understand the principle of two creations and accept the responsibility for both, we act within and enlarge the borders of our Circle of Influence. To the extent to which we do not operate in harmony with this principle and take charge of the first creation, we diminish it. It\\'s a principle that all things are created twice, but not all first creations are by conscious design. In our personal lives, if we do not develop our own self-awareness and become responsible for first creations, we empower other people and circumstances outside our Circle or Influence to shape much of our lives by default. We reactively live the scripts handed to us by family, associates, other people\\'s agendas, the pressures of circumstance -- scripts from our earlier years, from our training, our conditioning These scripts come from people, not principles. And they rise out of our deep vulnerabilities, our deep dependency on others and our need for acceptance and love, for belonging, for a sense of importance and worth, for a feeling that we matter.","title":"Habit 2: Begin with the End in Mind"},{"location":"Personal_Development/7_habits_of_highly_effective_people/#personal-mission-statement","text":"People can\\'t live with change if there\\'s not a changeless core inside them. The key to the ability to change is a changeless sense of who you are, what you are about and what you value. With a mission statement, we can flow with changes. We don\\'t need prejudgments or prejudices. We don\\'t need to figure out everything else in life, to stereotype and categorize everything and everybody in order to accommodate reality In order to write a personal mission statement, we must begin at the very center of our Circle of Influence, that center comprised of our most basic our paradigms, the lens through which we see the world. It is here that we deal with our vision and our values. It is here that we use our endowment of self-awareness to examine our maps and, if we value correct principles, to make certain that our maps accurately describe the territory, that our paradigms are based on principles and reality. It is here that we use our endowment of conscience as a compass to help us detect our own unique talents and areas of contribution. It is here that we use our endowment of imagination to mentally create the end we desire, giving direction and purpose to our beginnings and providing the substance of a written personal constitution. Whatever is at the center of our life will be the source of our security, guidance, wisdom, and power. Security represents your sense of worth, your identity, your emotional anchorage, your self-esteem, your basic personal strength or lack of it. Guidance means your source of direction in life. Encompassed by your map, your internal frame of reference that interprets for you what is happening out there, are standards or principles or implicit criteria that govern moment-by-moment decision-making and doing. These four factors -- security, guidance, wisdom, and power -- are interdependent. Security and clear guidance bring true wisdom, and wisdom becomes the spark or catalyst to release and direct power. When these four factors are present together, harmonized and enlivened by each other, they create the great force of a noble personality, a balanced character, a beautifully integrated individual. Principles don\\'t react to anything. They won\\'t divorce us or run away with our best friend. They aren\\'t out to get us. They can\\'t pave our way with shortcuts and quick fixes. They don\\'t depend on the behavior of others, the environment, or the current fad for their validity. Principles don\\'t die. They aren\\'t here one day and gone the next. They can\\'t be destroyed by fire, earthquake, or theft. Principles are deep, fundamental truths, classic truths, and generic common denominators. They are tightly interwoven threads running with exactness, consistency, beauty, and strength through the fabric of life. The wisdom and guidance that accompany Principle-Centered Living come from correct maps, from the way things really are, have been, and will be. Correct maps enable us to clearly see where we want to go and how to get there. We can make our decisions using the correct data that will make their implementation possible and meaningful. The personal power that comes from Principle-Centered Living is the power of a self-aware, knowledgeable, proactive individual, unrestricted by the attitudes, behaviors, and actions of others or by many of the circumstances and environmental influences that limit other people. Frankl says we detect rather than invent our missions in life. I like that choice of words. I think each of us has an internal monitor or sense, a conscience that gives us an awareness of our own uniqueness and the singular contributions that we can make. In Frankl\\'s words, \\\"Everyone has his own specific vocation or mission in life. Therein he cannot be replaced, nor can his life be repeated. Thus, everyone\\'s task is as unique as is his specific opportunity to implement it. A mission statement is not something you write overnight. It takes deep introspection, careful analysis, thoughtful expression, and often many rewrites to produce it in final form. It may take you several weeks or even months before you feel really comfortable with it, before you feel it is a complete and concise expression of your innermost values and directions. Even then, you will want to review it regularly and make minor changes as the years bring additional insights or changing circumstances. But fundamentally, your mission statement becomes your constitution, the solid expression of your vision and values. It becomes the criterion by which you measure everything else in your life. There are a number of techniques using your imagination that can put you in touch with your values. But the net effect of every one I have ever used is the same. When people seriously undertake to identify what really matters most to them in their lives, what they really want to be and to do, they become very reverent. They start to think in larger terms than today and tomorrow. In effective personal leadership, visualization and affirmation techniques emerge naturally out of a foundation of well thought through purposes and principles that become the center of a person\\'s life. They are extremely powerful in re-scripting and reprogramming, into writing deeply committed-to purposes and principles into one\\'s heart and mind. I believe that central to all enduring religions in society are the same principles and practices clothed in different language -- meditation, prayer, covenants, ordinances, scripture study, empathy, compassion, and many different forms of the use of both conscience and imagination.","title":"Personal mission statement"},{"location":"Personal_Development/7_habits_of_highly_effective_people/#habit-3-put-first-things-first","text":"Habit 3, then, is the second creation -- the physical creation. It\\'s the fulfillment, the actualization, the natural emergence of Habits 1 and 2. It\\'s the exercise of independent will toward becoming principle-centered. It\\'s the day-in, day-out, moment-by-moment doing it. The key is not to prioritize what\\'s on your schedule, but to schedule your priorities. And this can best be done in the context of the week. Quadrant I -- Important and Urgent -- crises, deadline-driven projects, and pressing problems\\ Quadrant II -- Important and Not Urgent -- preparation, planning, and relationship building\\ Quadrant III -- Not Important and Urgent -- interruptions, most phone calls and mail and reports\\ Quadrant IV -- Not Important and Not Urgent -- trivia, busywork, time wasters, and escape activities Quadrant II organizing involves four key activities. Identifying Roles: The first task is to write down your key roles. If you haven\\'t really given serious thought to the roles in your life, you can write down what immediately comes to mind. You have a role as an individual. You may want to list one or more roles as a family member -- a husband or wife, mother or father, son or daughter, a member of the extended family of grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins. You may want to list a few roles in your work, indicating different areas in which you wish to invest time and energy on a regular basis. You may have roles in church or community affairs. You don\\'t need to worry about defining the roles in a way that you will live with for the rest of your life -- just consider the week and write down the areas you see yourself spending time in during the next seven days. e.g.: Individual Husband/Father Manager New Products Chairman United Way Personal Development Wife Mother Real Estate Salesperson Selecting Goals: The next step is to think of two or three important results you feel you should accomplish in each role during the next seven days. These would be recorded as goals. At least some of these goals should reflect Quadrant II activities. Ideally, these short-term goals would be tied to the longer-term goals you have identified in conjunction with your personal mission statement. But even if you haven\\'t written your mission statement, you can get a feeling, a sense, of what is important as you consider each of your roles and two or three goals for each role. Scheduling: Now you look at the week ahead with your goals in mind and schedule time to achieve them. For example, if your goal is to produce the first draft of your personal mission statement, you may want to set aside a two-hour block of time on Sunday to work on it. Sunday (or some other day of the week that is special to you, your faith, or your circumstances) is often the ideal time to plan your more personally uplifting activities, including weekly organizing. It\\'s a good time to draw back, to see inspiration, to look at your life in the context of principles and values. If you set a goal to become physically fit through exercise, you may want to set aside an hour three or four days during the week, or possibly every day during the week, to accomplish that goal. There are some goals that you may only be able to accomplish during business hours, or some that you can only do on Saturday when your children are home. Can you begin to see some of the advantages of organizing the week instead of the day? Daily Adapting: With Quadrant II weekly organizing, daily planning becomes more a function of daily adapting, or prioritizing activities and responding to unanticipated events, relationships, and experiences in a meaningful way. Taking a few minutes each morning to review your schedule can put you in touch with the value-based decisions you made as you organized the week as well as unanticipated factors that may have come up. As you overview the day, you can see that your roles and goals provide a natural prioritization that grows out of your innate sense of balance. It is a softer, more right-brain prioritization that ultimately comes out of your sense of personal mission. You simply can\\'t think efficiency with people. You think effectiveness with people and efficiency with things. I\\'ve tried to be \\\"efficient\\\" with a disagreeing or disagreeable person and it simply doesn\\'t work. I\\'ve tried to give 10 minutes of \\\"quality time\\\" to a child or an employee to solve a problem, only to discover such \\\"efficiency\\\" creates new problems and seldom resolves the deepest concern.","title":"Habit 3: Put First Things First"},{"location":"Personal_Development/7_habits_of_highly_effective_people/#delegation","text":"Stewardship delegation involves clear, up-front mutual understanding and commitment regarding expectations in five areas. Desired Results: Create a clear, mutual understanding of what needs to be accomplished, focusing on what, not how; results, not methods. Spend time. Be patient. Visualize the desired result. Have the person see it, describe it, make out a quality statement of what the results will look like, and by when they will be accomplished. Guidelines: Identify the parameters within which the individual should operate. These should be as few as possible to avoid methods delegation, but should include any formidable restrictions. You won\\'t want a person to think he had considerable latitude as long as he accomplished the objectives, only to violate some long-standing traditional practice or value. That kills initiative and sends people back to the gofer\\'s creed: \\\"Just tell me what you want me to do, and I\\'ll do it.\\\" Let people learn from your mistakes or the mistakes of others. Point out the potential failure paths, what not to do, but don\\'t tell them what to do. Keep the responsibility for results with them -- to do whatever is necessary within the guidelines. Resources: Identify the human, financial, technical, or organizational resources the person can draw on to accomplish the desired results. Accountability: Set up the standards of performance that will be used in evaluating the results and the specific times when reporting and evaluation will take place. Consequences: Specify what will happen, both good and bad, as a result of the evaluation.

In fact, it is one of six paradigms of interaction. The alternative paradigms are win-lose, lose-win, lose-lose, win, and Win-Win or No Deal Win-win is a frame of mind and heart that constantly seeks mutual benefit in all human interactions. Win-win means that agreements or solutions are mutually beneficial, mutually satisfying. With a win-win solution, all parties feel good about the decision and feel committed to the action plan. Win-win sees life as a cooperative, not a competitive arena. Most people tend to think in terms of dichotomies: strong or weak, hardball or softball, win or lose. But that kind of thinking if fundamentally flawed. It\\'s based on power and position rather than on principle. Win-win is based on the paradigm that there is plenty for everybody, that one person\\'s success is not achieved at the expense or exclusion of the success of others. Win-win is a belief in the Third Alternative. It\\'s not your way or my way; it\\'s a better way, a higher way. No deal basically means that if we can\\'t find a solution that would benefit us both, we agree to disagree agreeably -- no deal. No expectations have been created, no performance contracts established. I don\\'t hire you or we don\\'t take on a particular assignment together because it\\'s obvious that our values or our goals are going in opposite directions. It is so much better to realize this up front instead of downstream when expectations have been created and both parties have been disillusioned. Anything less than win-win in an interdependent reality is a poor second best that will have impact in the long-term relationship. The cost of the impact needs to be carefully considered. If you can\\'t reach a true win-win, you\\'re very often better off to go for no deal. Win-Win or No Deal provides tremendous emotional freedom in the family relationship. If family members can\\'t agree on a video that everyone will enjoy, they can simply decide to do something else -- no deal -- rather than having some enjoy the evening at the expense of others. In my own work with various people and organizations seeking win-win solutions, I suggest that they become involved in the following four-step process: See the problem from the other point of view. Really seek to understand and give expression to the needs and concerns of the other party as well as or better than they can themselves. Identify the key issues and concerns (not positions) involved. Determine what results would constitute a fully acceptable solution. Identify possible new options to achieve those results.","title":"Habit 4: Think Win-Win -- Principles of Interpersonal Leadership"},{"location":"Personal_Development/7_habits_of_highly_effective_people/#habit-5-seek-first-to-understand-then-to-be-understood","text":"Most people do not listen with the intent to understand; they listen with the intent to reply.

If you practice those techniques, you may not project your autobiography in the actual interaction, but your motive in listening is autobiographical. You listen with reflective skills, but you listen with intent to reply, to control, to manipulate. When I say empathic listening, I mean listening with intent to understand.

The essence of empathic listening is not that you agree with someone; it\\'s that you fully, deeply, understand that person, emotionally as well as intellectually. In empathic listening, you listen with your ears, but you also, and more importantly, listen with your eyes and with your heart. You listen for feeling, for meaning. You listen for behavior. You use your right brain as well as your left. You sense, you intuit, you feel. Empathic listening is so powerful because it gives you accurate data to work with.

It's about giving yourself adequate time to respond to your feelings, asking the right questions about your anger, choosing how to respond when you get mad, and deciding if you're willing to pay the consequences for outrageous behavior. Just because you have the right to be angry doesn't mean you have to exercise that right! Acknowledge your anger as soon as you experience it. Use your anger to better understand yourself. Express your anger without venting Stop saying you're \"fine\" when you're not. Confess your anger on a daily basis. Think of anger as your ally rather than your enemy. Find healthy ways --- like exercise --- to let off steam. Think of anger as a legitimate emotion just like love and joy. Start saying \"Excuse you!\" to people who treat you badly. Let yourself off the hook by forgiving others. Live in the present, not the past. Forgo reciprocity --- there's no such thing as getting even. Come back and discuss the reasons for your anger after you walk away. Anger is neither bad nor good Anger serves a variety of positive purposes when it comes to coping with stress. It energizes you, improves your communication with other people, promotes your self-esteem, and defends you against fear and insecurity. (Jesus, Gandhi, and Martin Luther King, Jr., were all angry men --- but they turned that anger into social reform that made the world a better place.) When it leads to domestic violence, property damage, sexual abuse, drug addiction, ulcers, and self-mutilation, anger is definitely not good. You want to have emotions but you want to be in control of those emotions. Quantifying your anger Anger, is not the same as: Hostility: An attitude of ill will synonymous with cynicism, mistrust, and paranoia Aggression or violence : Various types of behavior that are always intended to inflict harm on others How often do you get angry (episodic or chronic) and how intense is your anger on a scale from 1-10 (mild -- extreme)? 1 - 3 = irritability, annoyed 4 - 6 = anger 7 -- 10 = rage Anger is in the eye of the beholder. It's not the things that happen to you that make you angry as much as it is the way you respond to those things. Views that emphasize anger: Cynicism Everything is a catastrophe Everything in life is either black or white It's all about me You're always asking the same question over and over: \"Why aren't they treating me fairly?\" The question you should be asking is: \" Why do I get so angry whenever I don't get what I want when I want it?\" Anger is like a mirror --- your own personal mirror. Look into it and see what comes back at you. Maybe you're spoiled or you're a bit grandiose in what you expect of yourself and others at work. Maybe they're not the problem --- maybe you are. Look around at the other people you work with. Are they as angry at work as you are? If not, and if they're doing the same work, you should ask yourself why. Why are you angry and they're not? All that anger that you're spewing out over the years can rob your family of energy, make them ill, and ruin their careers as well. Managing your anger today Take immediate action Anger, by its very nature, is meant to be short lived. It comes and it goes like a wave hitting the beach. For most people, anger is over within five to ten minutes. How do you settle for just being annoyed? Don't think of the incident or situation as more serious than it is Don't take it personally Don't blame the other person Don't think about revenge Keep striving for a non-angry way of coping with the situation Listen to nice music Think about something pleasant Take some type of action to adjust to or correct the annoying situation. Walking away but coming back This is an alternative for flight or fight. The problem is that neither of these extreme options helps you manage anger. If you decide to stand and fight, you need to remain angry long enough to overcome the threat --- and the intensity of your anger may become accelerated in the process. On the other hand, if you retreat from the threat, you end up taking your angry feelings with you. You can outrun the threat, but not your own emotions. You can disengage (walk away) initially (\"Excuse me. Give me a minute. I'll be right back,\"), but return later (\"Okay, what was it you wanted to say?\"), after you've calmed down sufficiently to discuss how to resolve the conflict. This is the most mature way to handle anger-provoking problems, but also the one most people are least likely to choose. Stopping the rage Focus on your anger and the reactions to your anger rather than the source of your anger Respond rather than react Your response is predictable (not unpredictable as when you are angry) Thoughtful Not impulsive In control Repeat to yourself as many times as necessary, \"This too shall pass.\" Breathe Take a deep, exaggerated breath in through your nose. Hold the breath for a count of one Now, exhale in an exaggerated way through your mouth. Repeat the exercise at least ten times Think the word release with each exhale. This is your mind's command to the body to let go of this unwanted tension. Your body will follow the command. Just by being quiet for a few moments, while you continue to formulate your response to anger, you'll begin to calm down. Ask yourself 4 questions Who am I really angry at? Is this the right time and place to be angry? Why am I angry? Is the intensity of my anger consistent with why I'm angry? Come up with other alternatives as to why the other person did what she did to trigger your rage Then pick the one that will produce the least adverse emotional consequences Say aloud to yourself, \"Stop!\" and shift your attention to something else. Engage in some positive rumination --- otherwise known as daydreaming (imagine something positive) Instead of imagining yourself in another positive situation, imagine yourself in the same situation that caused your anger, but without any feelings of anger. Imagine yourself in the same (or different) situation, but feeling a negative emotion other than anger (for example, sadness). Speaking out in anger Screaming at someone that he's a \"@#\\$%head!\" communicates nothing but raw anger. It doesn't tell the person why you're angry. You need to use your anger to educate, inform, and share that part of yourself that is hurt, sad, frustrated, insecure, and feels attacked with the person who tapped into these feelings. Come up with a label to identify the intensity of your anger. For example, are you annoyed, irritated, mad, irate, or in a rage? Start by saying, \"I feel. . . .\" Don't say, \"I think. . . .\" What you're going for here is your feeling, not your thoughts about how unpleasant the other person was. Identify what really triggered your anger in the first place Ask yourself what it would take to help you return to a non-angry state. For example, \"I would appreciate it if he would ask his friends to leave when I get home from work so we can have some one-on-one time.\" When you're able to go through these three steps inside your head, see if you can actually have that conversation with the person you're angry with. When speaking up in anger keep it short. It is not what you say; it is how you say it: Keep pace slow and volume low Preventing anger Anger is the emotion of intolerance. Intolerance means you don't accept another person's viewpoint or behavior. Anger says that you think you're right and the other person is wrong. It can't be any simpler than that. Anger defends the listener against any change in his way of thinking. Instead of accepting the challenge of an honest difference of opinion, the intolerant person resorts to intimidation, insult, or withdrawal --- all fueled by anger ---as a way of rigidly holding on to his beliefs. Instead of being defensive (that's what intolerance is all about!), go on the offense. Say to the other person, \"Tell me more about that. I'd like to understand how you arrived at that opinion. This is your chance to educate me.\" Look for points of agreement Keep your eyes open and your mouth shut. A Zen approach to overcoming anger Anger is often an immediate but irrational reaction based on a notion we have in our heads. Whether the event is trivial or significant, the cause of anger is always the same. Underlying the emotional tumult, there is a need that is not being met and that you expect to be met. The demand, in a very broad sense, is the \"because\" underlying our anger. \"I was angry because . . . .\" If you can pause to consider what your demand (or need or expectation) is when you feel anger arising, you will have gone a long way toward changing it. Whether or not you follow any of the other suggestions in this book, you will find this simple exercise to be of great value. In fact, certain types of anger may dissolve with no other effort. So the first step is to own your anger. As long as you don't act on it, no one but you will keep score no matter how many times a day you get angry. One of the things that you realize when you see the nature of the self is that what you do and what happens to you are the same thing. Realizing that you do not exist separately from everything else, you realize responsibility: You are responsible for everything you experience. You can no longer say, 'He made me angry.' How could he make you angry? Only you can make you angry. On the temple it is written even still . . . that the giver should be thankful; only then is it a sharing. . . . Somebody accepted you through your gift. He could have rejected [it], there was no necessity to accept it. The giver should be thankful. Then it becomes a sharing, otherwise it is always a bargain. You are expecting something---something more valuable than you have given. When someone becomes enlightened, he can share, and he will do whatsoever he can just to share it. When confronted with someone else's anger, use these steps. Make space before speaking or responding. Take some deep breaths. Check the face and body of the person in front of you to understand what's going on. Observe physiological cues. Watch especially for changes in the trust level. When a person becomes more relaxed, their eyes will be open and they will lean slightly toward you. Consider the consequences of not doing anything---whether something that might be helpful in the short run may lead to harm later. Ask yourself: What assumptions am I making? Ask the person what the problem is. Consider your involvement in causing it. Respect and empathize with both your own boundaries, values, and limitations and those of the other person. A conflict may be the result of differing values, for instance, two family members disagreeing about whether to take care of a parent in a nursing facility or at home. One wants safety for her, the other wants her happiness. The safety-minded person might come clean and admit, \"I can't be here all the time; I'm afraid she might hurt herself.\" The other might say, \"I would always be upset with myself if I didn't support Mother's wishes.\" Then it becomes an argument about concerns instead of positions. Speak from right attitude. Ask yourself, \"What do I really need to communicate to this person?\" and refrain from venting your feelings for other motives. Check for self-indulgence, ill will, potential harm in one's own words and actions. Ask yourself not only what must I say, but how must I say it. Deliberately, do not take revenge. In Buddhism, the basic vow is benefiting all beings, not everyone except this particular person. If you are a man who leads,\\ Listen calmly to the speech of one who pleads;\\ Don't stop him from purging his body Of that which he planned to tell.\\ A man in distress wants to pour out his heart\\ More than that his case be won. ---The Instructions of Ptahhotep If you don't like what just happened, you have the opportunity to change the next installment in the soap opera of your life in grand or subtle ways. Human intelligence gives you the power to react other than by instinct or habit. Intelligence is the power of choice. Anger cripples rational thought and therefore limits your choices. But by using the full power of your intellect and choosing not to act out of anger and habit, you can increase the odds that the events of the future will be more to your liking. Why we get mad? Anger is good for you as long as you understand, manage, and use it in healthy ways. Like all emotions, anger exists in us because it offered our human and nonhuman ancestors a survival benefit. These brain structures, facial expressions, and body postures did not happen by accident. They happened through hundreds of millions of years of our ancestors surviving hostile forces of nature. Anger alerts you to injustice. Anger energizes you to confront injustice. Anger communicates your status to others. Anger is, pure and simple, an emotion. It is the feeling state that arises in us when we have our goals blocked or when we experience an injustice. Emotions are fundamentally separate from behaviors. Anger is a normal and often healthy response to a variety of situations. Anger can be understood, managed, and used in a way that is healthy, positive, and prosocial. Anger is an emotion, aggression and violence are reactions/behaviours. People can get afraid seeing people acting aggressively due to anger There is no single best way to express anger. Anger expressions are perceived differently based on the gender, race, and other characteristics of the angry person. The consequences of those expressions are very different based on the gender, race, and other characteristics of the angry person. Provocation a. Injustice b. poor treatment c. goal-blocking.

We awaken when we become aware of who we truly are. The mind, then---meaning the beliefs we live by that drive so much of what we think and feel---is the true starting place for change. An awakened parent is one who is aware that the traditional paradigms of parenting, where the parent is seen as greater than the child, are obsolete in the modern world, producing dysfunction and disconnection in families. Instead, they are willing to be the architects of a new model of parenthood where parent and child are seen as equal, serving as mutual partners on a path of growth founded on increasing consciousness. Parents view their children as mirrors through which they are able to see how they themselves need to mature and develop. Instead of fixing what they see as faults in their children, these parents seek to work on themselves, raising their own levels of maturity and presence. The focus is always on the parent's awareness rather than the child's behavior. This is the core insight of the book. We act too often through our ego (inner voice, unconsciousness). A child has the ability to bring to our attention just how unconscious much of our parenting is. Fear and anxiety as a source of many problems As parents who are trying our best to do a good job, we don't realize that it's precisely our fears for our children, which we think of as concern, that are the problem with most parenting. These fears often take the form of intense anxiety with regard to our children. Whatever its precise manifestation, our fears undermine so many of our good intentions. Fear is the reason our parenting somehow manages to produce results that are the exact opposite of what we were aiming for. Our children may be small and powerless in terms of living independent lives, but they are mighty in their potential to be our awakeners. Perhaps more than anything, becoming a parent offers us the opportunity to become aware of patterns established in childhood. Because of our children's closeness to us, they offer us a mirror of ourselves. Through them, we are brought face-to-face with what it must have felt like for us to be a child. Instead of reacting to our children because of what they are showing us about ourselves, the conscious response is to look into the mirror they are holding up to us, allowing ourselves to become aware of the many ways in which we still behave like children ourselves not in control of our own emotions. The reason neither traditional (it's the child's fault) nor contemporary (be calm and understanding) responses to children's provocations are effective for long is that they don't get to the root of the behavior. The focus of the various techniques parents read about or pick up from experts or other parents is on the particular behavior, not on the dynamics that underlie the behavior. These techniques are all about controlling children so their actions don't trigger us. We tell ourselves that if we could just get the child to \"do\" or \"not do\" certain things, we wouldn't react the way we do. It's a game in which both parent and child are always trying to stay one step ahead of the other. Needless to say, the game results in anger, anxiety, and frequently disappointment and even sadness. Pushing buttons We are triggered not by their behavior, but by our own unresolved emotional issues. The problem isn't the child's behavior, but why it sets us off. Unless we examine why the behavior causes us to react negatively, we will never change the patterns of interaction between our children and us---and this is true of any close relationship. Example of conscious reacting \"Is my child in some way reflecting the way I tend to operate? Are there ways I need to restructure my life so I can be more organized?\" Am I trying to protect my child from making the same failure that I made? Am I authentic? Am I controlling my emotions or am I throwing a tantrum? When we ignore the immature ways we sometimes behave toward our children, by making use of the \"power\" we have over them, which they consistently reflect back to us, we turn down one of the most profound opportunities to grow ourselves up. Creating the right environment instead of controlling Parenting needs to shift from controlling our children, which is rooted in our fears and serves to impede their progress, to supporting the development of their physical, emotional, and mental capacities. Help your kids to listen to their own desires rather than allowing others to influence their decisions. Clash of time zones Don't focus on planning, doing and keeping them busy for the sake of it. Parents are oriented to the future, to getting to wherever they imagine themselves to be going. Children, on the other hand, when left to themselves inhabit the present. Most of the disconnection between parent and child comes down to this rupture between a life enjoyed moment by moment and a life that's focused on moving ahead. When children feel seen, believe they are worthy, and discern that they matter for who they are as a person and not just because of what they accomplish, they are able to enjoy their own sense of empowerment. I now realize how I had it wrong, Upside down and outside in, It is you who is there to wake me up to my true self. Putting too much pressure on your kids Many of the expectations we have of our children are unspoken. Despite what we don't put into words, children intuitively sense when we wish them to be other than they are---sense that we want them to fulfill our fantasies of who they will grow up to be and what they will accomplish. Don't think your kid is too shy, too much of an introvert or anything else just let them be themselves. Many children suffer from guilt, and in many cases live in a state of shame, because they are unable to perform to their parents' satisfaction. Placing expectations on your child instead of allowing the child's own natural inclinations to emerge spontaneously may well result in an emotional Grand Canyon between you and your child. As the gap widens, a flood of anxiety will rush in to fill it---anxiety not only for your child but also for yourself. Parenting is not only about the child When we buy into the myth that parenting is about the child, we readily take credit for our wonderful parenting when our children match up to our expectations, whereas we just as readily place blame on them when they don't meet our expectations. To parent consciously is to turn this approach on its head. The focus shifts to the parent as the one who needs to be \"raised.\" In other words, we put ourselves under scrutiny, not our children. As adults, and now parents ourselves, we find ourselves unexpectedly triggered by an experience with our own child. What's happening is that pain from our past is being reactivated. Conscious parenting stresses how our children act as a mirror for what we can't see about ourselves. They bring to the surface the pain we haven't processed but that's now causing us to react so strongly, and often irrationally, to their behavior. Unless we take seriously what they are showing us about how hurt we have been---and how we have never really faced up to this hurt---we will raise them to exhibit the same immature behavior that reflects our unresolved pain. This is the essence of the profound journey of parenting. Instead of trying to \"fix\" our children, we are asked to turn inward and examine what in our own psyche needs to be resolved. \"Your child is fine being ordinary. It's your own sense of lack that needs them to be labeled extraordinary. They don't have this need---your ego does.\" Let your child be average. Most children feel they are on earth to live a life that matches up to their parents' standards, in return for which they hope to receive their parents' love. Instead of seeing her as defiant, they now realized that she was defending herself. Just this small shift in perspective allowed them to work with her in a whole new way. Now they couldn't just pin all the blame on her but instead had to ask themselves, \"Why does our child feel the need to be so defensive? What can we do to help her?\" As they examined their part, they were able to release her from the burden of being \"the defiant one.\" Unconditional love They need us to switch from a focus on molding them in the name of love to one of creating space for them to show up as they need to, even when they are being irrational and unpredictable. Children want nothing more than to feel they have our permission to express who they are at any given moment. No, I'm not talking about mindlessly indulging them, but rather about creating the conditions for them to express their whole self. When we give them this freedom, they experience a vast, unbounded spaciousness in which to discover themselves and ultimately flourish. They feel our love as love, not as control born of our fear. Holy grail of happiness In the search for eternal happiness we don't realize that this means we are conditioned to depend on life working out in a particular way, we appear helpless when it doesn't. Only when we separate the internal (ourselves) from the external (things that happen in life) do we realize that who we are internally can continue to adjust, and in fact flourish, despite our external situation. The challenge is to see the pleasure and the pain of life equal in terms of the opportunity they present us. If we approached life this way, and showed our children how to do so, we would stop searching for happiness, knowing that the process of engaging whatever comes our way holds the greatest fulfillment. To understand true happiness, we need only to observe young children. hey don't wait to be happy until they are rich, thin, pretty, or in the \"right\" social circle. Engaging in life \"as is\" rather than doing -- avoidance of unhappiness Children inherently know how to engage life as it is. They cry and throw tantrums, but they don't attach their sense of worth to what may be happening. Unless taught otherwise, they are ready to pick themselves up when life doesn't go their way. Children feel their feelings and move on without being attached or getting a victim of the circumstances or judging life on how it makes them feel. By training our children to be outcome-oriented, engaging life based on whether a particular experience makes them feel good or not, we teach them that if an activity doesn't qualify, they should avoid it and look for an experience that promises happiness. Thus, because of our fear that they might experience some kind of pain, they miss out on the immediate experience of life. Control over children The only control we have, as parents, involves our own feelings and reactions, together with the conditions we set in our home. Our problem is that we don't really know how to control ourselves or the conditions we create in our home, which steers us in the direction of controlling our children instead. Acting out of fear vs. out of love We have all experienced moments of sheer panic, when our reactions are all about fear-laden control, as opposed to understanding and connection. Our children stay awake doing homework, but our fear that they won't get enough sleep causes us to bark or yell at them instead of empathizing with them. Or our child doesn't manage to master the skill of potty training on time, but instead of entering deep patience and teaching them this skill, we find ourselves riddled with fear that they will be rejected from kindergarten and will wither away at home, isolated and friendless. \\~ The Gift \\~ May you be blessed with a child . . .

May you be blessed with a child . . . Who teaches you That it is never about them And all about you. Pushing and bad intentions We push our children much more than they ever push us. For instance, when does a child ever start each day with lists and schedules as we do? They don't make a zillion plans for us and force us to go places we don't want to go. They don't threaten us when we don't eat the food they like or don't wear the clothes they choose for us. It's we who initiate such dynamics, rigidly forcing on them our standards. Naturally, we couch these things in terms such as giving them opportunities, promoting good health, exposing them to life's possibilities, and showing our support for them. If we were honest with ourselves, we would admit that all of this is just manipulation so we can get our way. When we understand that less-than-desirable behavior is a signal of something else, we are reminded to connect with our children in a more meaningful manner. When we view their behavior through the lens of cause and effect, instead of rushing to judgment about their character, we become curious about their feelings and experiences. This approach does wonders in terms of building trust and thereby drawing our children closer to us. Instead of attempting to get our children to change, the challenge is to transform our energy from a state of neediness to one of empowerment based on an awareness of the abundance at our disposal. By asking, \"Can I become what I need my children to be?\" we start to embody the qualities we wish them to absorb. To shift from believing that life happens to us, to understanding that life happens for us and with our participation, enables us to find the jewel in every experience Our instinct is to lash out. If someone irritates us, we don't think twice but simply react. \"Hey, what's wrong with you? Can you stop what you are doing?\" It doesn't occur to us to say, \"Why am I getting so agitated right now?

If I can let go of my need to control I can enter the unknown with vigor. Flowing with grit, resilience, and power, I can become the agent Of the transformation I wish to witness. Resisting nothing, I greet the present moment with awareness and joy. Being you, balance energy rather than mirror (throwing tantrums yourself) Drawing on the abundant nature of reality begins with accepting ourselves exactly as we are. This is fundamentally different from seeing ourselves primarily in a particular kind of role, such as a mom or dad. Though roles can be helpful at times, they need to be underpinned by the wholeness of pure being. Otherwise, roles can easily end up seriously unbalancing our energy as we become locked into a mental image of who we are \"supposed\" to be as a mom or dad, instead of being who we truly are. Embody the principle of balance, try to round out my child's energy by occupying the opposite end of whatever they experience. For example, if she is anxious, I become grounded in my sense of trust; if she is angry, I enter stillness; if she is frustrated, I enter peace. By resisting the urge to match her energy and thereby amplify it, I try to take on its antidotal properties. This silent but profound shift in my energy allows her to naturally balance out her energy and find her way back to self. By remaining grounded in ourselves, we show them that their emotions will pass and they will return to center. But how can they learn this if they have to watch us constantly being pushed and pulled by our own transient moods? Curious rather than furious \"I'm curious about your thoughts about this. Can you share?\" \"I'm wondering what you feel about that. Can you tell me?\" \"I would love to know how you came to that conclusion. Can you share your thinking?\" \"I'm fascinated by how you think and feel. I would love to know more.\" \"You sound like you are really experiencing strong feelings. Would you share them with me?\" Feelings vs emotions People often confuse emotions with feelings, as if the two were the same. I look at them as vastly different. Simply put, we react with an emotion when we are unable to handle our feelings. When we feel our feelings, we don't have time to engage in reactive emotions. We tune in and allow the feelings to speak to us, wash over us, and transform us. Aware that we are under waves of feeling, we do the opposite of emoting. We hush up, become still, and allow the significance of the feelings to grow us up. \"I have had a long day and am tired. I have no energy left and need to rest. This is why I am beginning to sound impatient and can barely hold it together. Can you please help me out here? \" \"Why do clothes on the floor affect my inner sense of stability? Why do I feel personally threatened to the point of lashing out at my child?\" Consumed with a mythical standard of \"how things should be,\" we often feel we have no choice but to react. We are compelled. However, by examining each reaction and identifying which myth is driving it (and often it's more than one), we can begin to tame our reactivity. All that's required is to observe what we tell ourselves in such situations. This enables us to recognize which cultural myth or myths we are in the clutches of. Feeling: You feel impatient with your child for being too slow. You feel helpless, frustrated, and incompetent. Reaction: You want to push them along, perhaps even yell at them. Entering the fear: Notice that you have been triggered. This is a red light, a warning to halt. Hit your internal freeze button. Notice your agitation, take a deep breath, then allow yourself to become quiet internally. If necessary, leave the room. Examine your fear by asking: What's the nature of the fear I'm experiencing? What am I afraid will happen? Is that really such a bad thing? Will it be the end of the world? Can I own that my fear stems from my past? Can I see that it has nothing to do with my child? Can I allow the feeling to pass through me and tap into a deeper trust? From judgement to empathy When we truly feel empathy for another, there is no agenda. A genuinely empathic response immediately recognizes that the other is in a state that's vastly different from our own, and that in order to connect with them we will have to forgo completely our own agenda. This swift letting go requires an alive presence that understands how connection with another is an engagement in which energy flows back and forth moment by moment with no guarantee of how things will end up. We understand that it's about the process of communicating, rather than where we need to end up or whose agenda needs to be met. It fully recognizes the importance of walking every step of the process together, with both parties engaged and empowered. Empathy is the ability to connect with what the other is feeling. This requires us to accept that it's okay for our child, partner, or friend to feel a certain way. Of course they do, since we are two distinct beings. This is the natural order of things in a healthy relationship. We don't need to change the other, any more than we need to change ourselves. We simply need to recognize the validity of the other's feelings, even as we want our own feelings to be recognized. Initially, holding the space within ourselves for both perspectives is extremely challenging. We can do this only if we aren't under siege from our own emotions. Anxiety constricts our inner space, causing it to quickly morph into control, which soon becomes anger.

We awaken when we become aware of who we truly are. The mind, then---meaning the beliefs we live by that drive so much of what we think and feel---is the true starting place for change. An awakened parent is one who is aware that the traditional paradigms of parenting, where the parent is seen as greater than the child, are obsolete in the modern world, producing dysfunction and disconnection in families. Instead, they are willing to be the architects of a new model of parenthood where parent and child are seen as equal, serving as mutual partners on a path of growth founded on increasing consciousness. Parents view their children as mirrors through which they are able to see how they themselves need to mature and develop. Instead of fixing what they see as faults in their children, these parents seek to work on themselves, raising their own levels of maturity and presence. The focus is always on the parent's awareness rather than the child's behavior. This is the core insight of the book. We act too often through our ego (inner voice, unconsciousness). A child has the ability to bring to our attention just how unconscious much of our parenting is.","title":"Conscious, mindful, awakened"},{"location":"Personal_Development/Awakened_family/#fear-and-anxiety-as-a-source-of-many-problems","text":"As parents who are trying our best to do a good job, we don't realize that it's precisely our fears for our children, which we think of as concern, that are the problem with most parenting. These fears often take the form of intense anxiety with regard to our children. Whatever its precise manifestation, our fears undermine so many of our good intentions. Fear is the reason our parenting somehow manages to produce results that are the exact opposite of what we were aiming for. Our children may be small and powerless in terms of living independent lives, but they are mighty in their potential to be our awakeners. Perhaps more than anything, becoming a parent offers us the opportunity to become aware of patterns established in childhood. Because of our children's closeness to us, they offer us a mirror of ourselves. Through them, we are brought face-to-face with what it must have felt like for us to be a child. Instead of reacting to our children because of what they are showing us about ourselves, the conscious response is to look into the mirror they are holding up to us, allowing ourselves to become aware of the many ways in which we still behave like children ourselves not in control of our own emotions. The reason neither traditional (it's the child's fault) nor contemporary (be calm and understanding) responses to children's provocations are effective for long is that they don't get to the root of the behavior. The focus of the various techniques parents read about or pick up from experts or other parents is on the particular behavior, not on the dynamics that underlie the behavior. These techniques are all about controlling children so their actions don't trigger us. We tell ourselves that if we could just get the child to \"do\" or \"not do\" certain things, we wouldn't react the way we do. It's a game in which both parent and child are always trying to stay one step ahead of the other. Needless to say, the game results in anger, anxiety, and frequently disappointment and even sadness.","title":"Fear and anxiety as a source of many problems"},{"location":"Personal_Development/Awakened_family/#pushing-buttons","text":"We are triggered not by their behavior, but by our own unresolved emotional issues.

Parents are oriented to the future, to getting to wherever they imagine themselves to be going. Children, on the other hand, when left to themselves inhabit the present. Most of the disconnection between parent and child comes down to this rupture between a life enjoyed moment by moment and a life that's focused on moving ahead. When children feel seen, believe they are worthy, and discern that they matter for who they are as a person and not just because of what they accomplish, they are able to enjoy their own sense of empowerment.

Don't think your kid is too shy, too much of an introvert or anything else just let them be themselves. Many children suffer from guilt, and in many cases live in a state of shame, because they are unable to perform to their parents' satisfaction. Placing expectations on your child instead of allowing the child's own natural inclinations to emerge spontaneously may well result in an emotional Grand Canyon between you and your child.

To parent consciously is to turn this approach on its head. The focus shifts to the parent as the one who needs to be \"raised.\" In other words, we put ourselves under scrutiny, not our children. As adults, and now parents ourselves, we find ourselves unexpectedly triggered by an experience with our own child. What's happening is that pain from our past is being reactivated. Conscious parenting stresses how our children act as a mirror for what we can't see about ourselves. They bring to the surface the pain we haven't processed but that's now causing us to react so strongly, and often irrationally, to their behavior. Unless we take seriously what they are showing us about how hurt we have been---and how we have never really faced up to this hurt---we will raise them to exhibit the same immature behavior that reflects our unresolved pain. This is the essence of the profound journey of parenting. Instead of trying to \"fix\" our children, we are asked to turn inward and examine what in our own psyche needs to be resolved. \"Your child is fine being ordinary. It's your own sense of lack that needs them to be labeled extraordinary. They don't have this need---your ego does.\" Let your child be average. Most children feel they are on earth to live a life that matches up to their parents' standards, in return for which they hope to receive their parents' love. Instead of seeing her as defiant, they now realized that she was defending herself. Just this small shift in perspective allowed them to work with her in a whole new way. Now they couldn't just pin all the blame on her but instead had to ask themselves, \"Why does our child feel the need to be so defensive? What can we do to help her?\" As they examined their part, they were able to release her from the burden of being \"the defiant one.\"","title":"Parenting is not only about the child"},{"location":"Personal_Development/Awakened_family/#unconditional-love","text":"They need us to switch from a focus on molding them in the name of love to one of creating space for them to show up as they need to, even when they are being irrational and unpredictable.

No, I'm not talking about mindlessly indulging them, but rather about creating the conditions for them to express their whole self.

The challenge is to see the pleasure and the pain of life equal in terms of the opportunity they present us. If we approached life this way, and showed our children how to do so, we would stop searching for happiness, knowing that the process of engaging whatever comes our way holds the greatest fulfillment.

By training our children to be outcome-oriented, engaging life based on whether a particular experience makes them feel good or not, we teach them that if an activity doesn't qualify, they should avoid it and look for an experience that promises happiness.

Notice their body language. Try to connect to their feelings beneath the words. Do the same for yourself. Enter a No-Judgment Zone Commit to being judgment-free today, no matter what the triggers. Be curious. Don't make statements out of impatient judgment. Pause and take a step back. Before you react with judgment, ask, \"Does this really matter in the long run?\" Express Feelings Safely Open conversations with observations, not questions; with comfort, not control. Invite your children to talk to you by letting them know they don't have to talk at all. Validate them to feel exactly what they feel at any given moment. Let Them Lead Empower your child to create their own schedule today, and you be their assistant. Harness your child's inner guide by allowing them to make decisions for the family appropriate to their maturity. Hand over the reins of your child's unstructured time to them. Let them govern themselves today. Be Spontaneous in Play Drop what you are doing and join your child in whatever they are doing---be it on their iPad, on their computer, or doing homework. Just sit by them and enter their world for a little while. Invite your child to choose one game or to lead in any one activity---baking a cake, making cookies, gluing pictures, taking a walk, throwing a ball---of their choosing that doesn ' t involve a screen. Just for fifteen to thirty minutes. Be present through it all. Be attentive for a moment to laugh with them, be it over a joke, a memory, or a riddle. Create the glue of laughter and good times, knowing that these will last lifetimes.","title":"Affirmations"},{"location":"Personal_Development/Ethics/","text":"Markers Assuring Cite authorities I'm sure Discounting use possible ways opponents can counter your argument.\\ -although\\ -while\\ -however\\ -but Guarding Used to Protect Premise form attack; weakens claim:\\ -All--> Most\\ introduces probability:\\ -its likely that...\\ Reduces level of commitment:\\ -I know that--> I believe that Premise/Argument marker Because Since Conclusion marker Therefore So Thus Hence Arguments validity Identify all of an argument's premises.

Biconditional premise (equivalence \\<=>) One of the big goals of ethical thinking is to try to identify a good, wide-ranging test of what's morally right (or wrong). One way to think about such a test is to view it as a statement of conditions that are both necessary and sufficient for being morally right (or wrong). A claim that supplies necessary and sufficient conditions is called a biconditional. A shorthand way to state biconditionals is to use this phrase: if and only if. someone is a bachelor if and only if he is an unmarried male. This says that being an unmarried male is both sufficient and necessary for being a bachelor: if someone is an unmarried male, then he's a bachelor, and he's a bachelor only if he's an unmarried male. Think of this as a kind of fill-in-the-blank exercise. In moral philosophy, we want sufficient conditions for being morally right. So: if (fill in your sufficient condition), then an act is morally right. Now make sure that however you filled in that blank is also a necessary condition : An act is morally right only if (fill in your sufficient condition) . The very same thing needs to fill in both blanks. So: an act is morally right if and only if. If you can fill in that blank in a way that withstands scrutiny, you will have done something truly great. You will have identified conditions that guarantee the moral rightness of an act, and that are also required for the act to be right. Forms of arguments that are always valid Fallacies Here's an example of one of them. Suppose your friend tells you that if God exists, then abortion is immoral. But she proceeds to claim that God doesn't exist. So, she concludes, abortion is morally OK.

So you think: well, if I don't buy it now, then I'm not going to get that discount. if I'm a millionaire, then I have at least ten dollars. (True.) I'm not a millionaire. (True.) Therefore, I don't have ten dollars. (False.) Premise 1 says that P is a guarantee for Q. Premise 2 says that this guarantee doesn't hold. What follows? Nothing. That's because there can be many sufficient conditions for something. If life is meaningful, then God exists; God does exist; therefore, life is meaningful. if I'm a millionaire, then I have ten dollars. (True.) I have ten dollars. (True.)

The compass represents our vision, values, principles, mission, conscience, direction what we feel is important and how we lead our lives. Focus on where you're headed rather than how fast you're going. (Compass vs. clock) We live in a modern society that loves shortcut techniques. Yet quality of life cannot be achieved by taking the right shortcut. Consequences: Can't seem to walk our talk Always in fire-fighting mode and never making time to do what we know would make a difference. Feeling so guilty over what we are not doing, we can't enjoy what we do For many of us, there's a gap between the compass and the clock between what's deeply important to us and the way we spend our time. And this gap is not closed by the traditional time management approach of doing more things faster. In fact, many of us find that increasing our speed only makes things worse. Fundamental to putting first things first in our lives is leadership before management: \"Am I doing the right things?\" before \"Am I doing things right?\" If we keep doing what we're doing, we're going to keep getting what we're getting. One definition of insanity is \"to keep doing the same things and expect different results.\" URGENCY ADDICTION Some of us get so used to the adrenaline rush of handling crises that we become dependent on it for a sense of excitement and energy. How does urgency feel? Stressful? Pressured? Tense? Exhausting? Sure. But let's be honest. It's also sometimes exhilarating. We feel useful. We feel successful. We feel validated. And we get good at it. It brings instant results and instant gratification. We get a temporary high from solving urgent and important crises. Then when the importance isn't there, the urgency fix is so powerful we are drawn to do anything urgent, just to stay in motion. People expect us to be busy, overworked. It's become a status symbol in our society if we're busy, we're important; if we're not busy, we're almost embarrassed to admit it. Busyness is where we get our security. It's validating, popular, and pleasing. It's also a good excuse for not dealing with the more important things. Quadrants Quadrant I (Production): represents things that are both urgent and important . Here's where we: handle an irate client meet a deadline repair a broken down machine undergo heart surgery Help a crying child who has been hurt. We need to spend time in Quadrant I. This is where we manage, where we produce, where we bring our experience and judgment to bear in responding too many needs and challenges. If we ignore it, we become buried alive. But we also need to realize that many important activities become urgent through procrastination, or because we don't do enough prevention and planning. Quadrant II (Increase production capacity): includes activities that are important, but not urgent . This is the Quadrant of Quality. Here's where we: do our long-range planning anticipate and prevent problems empower others broaden our minds increase our skills through reading and continuous professional development envision how we're going to help a struggling son or daughter prepare for important meetings and presentations invest in relationships through deep, honest listening Increasing time spent in this quadrant increases our ability to do. Ignoring this quadrant feeds and enlarges Quadrant I , creating stress, burnout, and deeper crises for the person consumed by it. On the other hand, investing in this quadrant shrinks Quadrant I. Planning, preparation, and prevention keep many things from becoming urgent. Quadrant II does not act on us; we must act on it. This is the Quadrant of personal leadership. Quadrant III : is almost the phantom of Quadrant I. It includes things that are urgent, but not important . This is the Quadrant of Deception . The noise of urgency creates the illusion of importance. But the actual activities, if they're important at all, are only important to someone else. Many phone calls, meetings, and drop-in visitors fall into this category. We spend a lot of time in Quadrant III meeting other people's priorities and expectations, thinking we're really in Quadrant I. Quadrant IV: is reserved for those activities that are not urgent and not important . We get so battle-scarred from being tossed around in Quadrants I and III that we often escape to Quadrant IV for survival. What kinds of things are in Quadrant IV? Not necessarily recreational things, because recreation in the true sense of recreation is a valuable Quadrant II activity. reading addictive light novels habitually watching mindless television shows gossiping around the water fountain Quadrant IV is not survival; it's deterioration. It may have an initial cotton candy feel, but we quickly find there's nothing there. Why does one not spend more time on Quadrant II activities? Because they're not urgent. They aren't pressing. They don't act on you. You have to act on them. When we operate out of the importance paradigm, we live in Quadrants I and II. We're out of Quadrants III and IV, and as we spend more time in preparation, prevention, planning, and empowerment, we decrease the amount of time we spend putting out fires in Quadrant I. Even the nature of Quadrant I changes. Most of the time, we're there by choice rather than default. We may even choose to make something urgent or timely because it's important. How to determine what is important? At the heart of the fourth generation are three fundamental ideas that empower us to answer that question: The fulfillment of the four human needs and capacities The reality of true north principles The potentiality of the four human endowments The fulfillment of the four human needs and capacities To Live, to Love, to Learn, to Leave a Legacy The need to live is our physical need for such things as food, clothing, shelter, economic well-being, health. The need to love is our social need to relate to other people, to belong, to love, to be loved. The need to learn is our mental need to develop and to grow. The need to leave a legacy is our spiritual need to have a sense of meaning, purpose, personal congruence, and contribution. Each of these needs is vitally important. Any one of these needs, unmet, reduces quality of life. These needs are real and deep and highly interrelated. Some of us recognize that we have these needs, but we tend to see them as separate compartments of life. We think of balance as running from one area to another fast enough to spend time in each one on a regular basis. But the touching bases paradigm ignores the reality of their powerful synergy. It's where these four needs overlap that we find true inner balance, deep fulfillment, and joy. The key to the fire within is our spiritual need to leave a legacy. It transforms other needs into capacities for contribution. Only as we focus more on contributing than consuming can we create the context that makes peace in all aspects of life possible. It's in leaving a legacy that we find meaning in living, loving, and learning. The reality of true north principles As important as the needs are to fulfill, is the way we seek to fulfill them. Our ability to create quality of life is a function of the degree to which our lives are aligned with extrinsic realities as we seek to fulfill the basic human needs. The reality of true north gives context and meaning to where we are, where we want to go, and how to get there. \"True north\" in the human dimension is an inner compass that empowers us to align our lives with it. Principles Principles are neither practices nor values but they are at higher level. If we understand and live our lives based on principles, we can quickly adapt; we can apply them anywhere. By teaching our children principles instead of practices, or teaching them the principles behind the practices, we better prepare them to handle the unknown challenges of the future. To understand the application may be to meet the challenge of the moment, but to understand the principle is to meet the challenge of the moment more effectively and to be empowered to meet a thousand challenges of the future as well. Law of the farm In agriculture, we can easily see and agree that natural laws and principles govern the work and determine the harvest. But in social and corporate cultures, we somehow think we can dismiss natural processes, cheat the system, and still win the day. In the short run, we may be able to go for the \"quick fix\" with apparent success. We can make impressions, we can put on the charm. We can learn manipulative techniques what lever to pull, what button to push to get the desired reaction. But long-term, the Law of the Farm governs in all areas of life. And there's no way to fake the harvest. The problems in life come when we're sowing one thing and expecting to reap something entirely different. The potentiality of the four human endowments As human beings, we have unique endowments that distinguish us from the animal world. These endowments reside in that space between stimulus and response, between those things that happen to us and our response to them. \"Between stimulus and response, there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom. \" The endowments that reside in this space self-awareness, conscience, creative imagination, and independent will create our ultimate human freedom: the power to choose, to respond, and to change. They create the compass that empowers us to align our lives with true north. Self-awareness... Self-awareness is our capacity to stand apart from ourselves and examine our thinking, our motives, our history, our scripts, our actions, and our habits and tendencies. It enables us to take off our glasses and look at them as well as through them. It makes it possible for us to become aware of the social and psychic history of the programs that are in us and to enlarge the separation between stimulus and response. Conscience Conscience connects us with the wisdom of the ages and the wisdom of the heart. It's our internal guidance system, which allows us to sense when we act or even contemplate acting in a way that's contrary to principle. It also gives us a sense of our unique gifts and mission. Independent will Independent will is our capacity to act. It gives us the power to transcend our paradigms, to swim upstream, to rewrite our scripts, to act based on principle rather than reacting based on emotion or circumstance. While environmental or genetic influences may be very powerful, they do not control us. We're not victims. We're not the product of our past. We are the product of our choices. We are \"response-able\" able to respond, to choose beyond our moods and tendencies. We have will power to act on self-awareness, conscience, and vision. Creative imagination Creative imagination is the power to envision a future state, to create something in our mind, and to solve problems synergistically. It's the endowment that enables us to see ourselves and others differently and better than we are now. It enables us to write a personal mission statement, set a goal, or plan a meeting. It also empowers us to visualize ourselves living our mission statement even in the most challenging circumstances, and to apply principles ineffective ways in new situations. The development of each of the four endowments and the synergy between them is the core of personal leadership. How to develop your endowments Our lives are the results of our choices. To blame and accuse other people, the environment, or other extrinsic factors is to choose to empower those things to control us. Nurture Self-awareness by Keeping a Personal Journal Educate the Conscience by Learning, Listening, and Responding reading and pondering over the wisdom literature of the ages to broaden our awareness of the true north principles that run as common themes throughout time standing apart from and learning from our own experience carefully observing the experience of others taking time to be still and listen to that deep inner voice Responding to that voice. Disobedience to conscience makes conscience blind. Nurture Independent Will by Making and Keeping Promises Each time we do this, we make deposits in our Personal Integrity Account. Don't violate that commitment and be sure you don't overpromise and underdeliver. Build slowly until your sense of honor becomes greater than your moods. Think carefully about the full reality you're in, and based on that careful thought, move into it and say, \"I will do this.\" And then, no matter what, do it. Little by little, your faith in yourself will increase. And if the thing you've committed to do is principle-centered, you gradually become a little more principle-centered. Little by little we increase our strength until our ability to act is more powerful than any of the forces that act upon us. Develop Creative Imagination through Visualization Set aside some time to be alone, away from interruptions. Close your eyes and visualize The best way to predict your future is to create it. Quadrant II organizing process: the process of putting 1^st^ things 1^st^ A thirty-minute weekly process and tool that will empower you to create quality of life based on needs, principles, and endowments. Principles empower us with an abundance mentality. There's more of everything. We can think win-win with all the roles in our lives, to see them as parts of a highly interrelated whole. STEP ONE: CONNECT WITH YOUR VISION AND MISSION As you begin to organize for the coming week, the first step is to connect with what's most important in your life as a whole. Context gives meaning. Consider the big picture what you care about, what makes the moments in your life meaningful. The key to this connection lies in the clarity of your vision around such questions as: http://msb.franklincovey.com/ (mission statement builder) What's most important? What gives your life meaning? What do you want to be and to do in your life? STEP TWO: IDENTIFY YOUR ROLES We live our lives in terms of roles not in the sense of role playing, but in the sense of authentic parts we've chosen to fill. We may have important roles at work, in the family, in the community, or in other areas of life. Roles represent responsibilities, relationships, and areas of contribution. Much of our pain in life comes from the sense that we're succeeding in one role at the expense of other, possibly even more important roles. We may be doing great as vice president of the company, but not doing well at all as a parent or spouse. A clear set of roles provides a natural framework to create order and balance. If you have a mission statement, your roles will grow out of it. Balance among roles does not simply mean that you're spending time in each role, but that these roles work together for the accomplishment of your mission. Identifying roles gives a sense of the wholeness of quality life that life is more than just a job, or a family, or a particular relationship. It's all of these together. Identifying roles may also highlight \"important, but not urgent\" areas that are currently being neglected. In addition to the roles you've identified, we'd like to suggest a separate and foundational role called \"sharpen the saw\". We treat this as a separate role for two reasons: 1) it's a role that everyone has, and 2) it's foundational for success in every other role. It's also important to realize that all of these roles are not distinct \"departments\" of life. They form a highly interrelated whole. By identifying your roles, you're not trying to break your life down and fit it into neat little boxes on a planning page. You're creating a variety of perspectives from which to examine your life to ensure balance and harmony. The paradigm is always one of importance, interdependence, and relatedness. STEP THREE: SELECT QUADRANT II GOALS IN EACH ROLE What is the most important thing I could do in each role this week to have the greatest positive impact? STEP FOUR: CREATE A DECISION-MAKING FRAMEWORK FOR THE WEEK Rocks in a jar metaphor https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6m9WnNdpSw Our Quadrant II goals are like the \"big rocks.\" If we put other activities the water, sand, and gravel in first, and then try to fit the big rocks in, not only will they not fit, we'll end up making a pretty big mess in the process. But if we know what the big rocks are and put them in first, it's amazing how many of them we can put in and how much of the sand, gravel, and water fits in between the spaces. Regardless of what else actually does fit in, the key point is that the big rocks our Quadrant II goals are in first. Leave some room because to ignore the unexpected (even if it were possible) would be to live without opportunity, spontaneity, and the rich moments of which life is made. STEP FIVE: EXERCISE INTEGRITY IN THE MOMENT STEP SIX: EVALUATE Planning & goal setting As people work together to accomplish any task, sooner or later they have to deal with five elements: Desired results: What is it we are trying to do? What outcomes do we want both quantitative and qualitative and by when? Frustration is essentially a function of expectation. Clarifying interdependent expectations up front does a great deal to contribute to quality of life. Guidelines: What are the parameters within which we are trying to do it? What are the essential values, policies, legalities, ethics, limits, and levels of initiative to be aware of in going after the desired results? Adapted from William Oncken's work are the following six levels of initiative (match the level of initiative with the capacity of the individual) 1. Wait until told 2. Ask 3. Recommend 4. Act and report immediately 5. Act and report periodically 6. Act on own Resources: What do we have to work with? What budgetary, systemic, and human help is available and how do we access it? It's important to identify not only the resources available, but also how to access them, how to work with others who use the same resources, and what the limits are. Accountability: How do we measure what we are doing? What criteria will indicate the accomplishment of the desired results? Will they be measurable, observable, or discernible, or some combination of the three? To whom are we accountable? When will the accountability process take place? Consequences: Why are we trying to do it? What are the natural and logical consequences of accomplishing or not accomplishing the desired results? Win-win Think Win-Win. You genuinely want the other person to win. You also want to win. You commit to interact until you can come up with a solution you both feel good about. Seek First to Understand As you seek mutual understanding, you may find it helpful to address the following questions: What is the problem from the other point of view? Really listen with intent to understand, not to reply. Step out of your own autobiography. Work at it until you can express the other person's point of view better than he or she can. Then encourage the other person to do the same. What are the key issues (not viewpoints) involved? Once the viewpoints are expressed and both parties feel thoroughly understood, look at the problem together and identify the issues that need to be resolved. What results would constitute a fully acceptable solution? Find out what would constitute a win for the other person. Identify what would constitute a win for you. Put both criteria on the table as the foundation for synergistic interaction. Synergize Open the door to the discovery of creative third-alternative solutions. Brainstorm. Use your MacGyver mentality. Open your mind. Be prepared for surprise. Try to create a list of possible options that would meet the criteria you've set up. Trust Both character and competence are necessary to inspire trust. And both are completely within our Circle of Influence. Character includes: Integrity - the ability to walk your talk, a thorough integratedness of public, private, and deep inner life around a balanced set of principles Majority - the balance of courage and consideration that enables you to say what needs to be said, to give honest feedback, to address issues in a straightforward way, but with consideration and respect for the feelings, thoughts, and opinions of others Abundance mentality - the paradigm that life is ever expanding, that there are an infinite number of third alternatives (in contrast to the paradigm that life is a zero sum game, that the pie is only so large and if anyone else gets a piece, that means less for me) Competence: Technical competence - the knowledge and skill to achieve the agreed-upon results; the ability to think through problems and look for new alternatives Conceptual competence -the ability to see the big picture, to examine assumptions and shift perspectives Interdependent competence -the ability to interact effectively with others, including the ability to listen, communicate, get to third alternatives, create win-win agreements, and work toward synergistic solutions; the ability to see and operate effectively and cooperatively in complete organizations and systems Interdependency Decision making Ask with intent How did this activity come about? Why am I doing it now? What are the underlying reasons for the activity? What are the ultimate objectives? Does this activity contribute to the purpose of the organization? Is this the highest and best use of my capacities and our combined resources? Is it within my circle of influence? Frustration = f(Expectations) Frustration is essentially a function of unmet expectations we expect something to be a certain way or to produce certain results, and it doesn't. As a result, we feel frustrated. Many of us expect consciously or subconsciously to be able to go through a day and accomplish what we planned. As a result, when some unexpected challenge comes up, we are frustrated. When someone has a need we didn't anticipate, we are frustrated. We see people essentially as interruptions. We view change as the enemy. Our peace and happiness are a function of whether or not we are able to make it through that day and check off everything on the list. But what happens when the expectation changes when we see each day as an exciting new adventure for which we have a roadmap, but also a compass that empowers us to navigate through uncharted terrain \u00e0 when we see problems as opportunities to help others \u00e0 when we look forward to meeting situations that challenge our priorities, confident that our compass will help us keep moving toward the best? What happens when our peace and happiness are a function of going to bed at night knowing we made the choices to put first things first throughout the day? Does that expectation make a difference in the way we interact with the realities of the day? Unmet expectations create frustration, but our expectations are within our control. We're not talking about lowering our expectations, but about basing them on the realities of true north.

Yet quality of life cannot be achieved by taking the right shortcut. Consequences: Can't seem to walk our talk Always in fire-fighting mode and never making time to do what we know would make a difference. Feeling so guilty over what we are not doing, we can't enjoy what we do For many of us, there's a gap between the compass and the clock between what's deeply important to us and the way we spend our time. And this gap is not closed by the traditional time management approach of doing more things faster. In fact, many of us find that increasing our speed only makes things worse. Fundamental to putting first things first in our lives is leadership before management: \"Am I doing the right things?\" before \"Am I doing things right?\" If we keep doing what we're doing, we're going to keep getting what we're getting.

And we get good at it. It brings instant results and instant gratification. We get a temporary high from solving urgent and important crises. Then when the importance isn't there, the urgency fix is so powerful we are drawn to do anything urgent, just to stay in motion. People expect us to be busy, overworked. It's become a status symbol in our society if we're busy, we're important; if we're not busy, we're almost embarrassed to admit it. Busyness is where we get our security.

Quadrant III : is almost the phantom of Quadrant I. It includes things that are urgent, but not important . This is the Quadrant of Deception . The noise of urgency creates the illusion of importance. But the actual activities, if they're important at all, are only important to someone else.

Any one of these needs, unmet, reduces quality of life. These needs are real and deep and highly interrelated.

We think of balance as running from one area to another fast enough to spend time in each one on a regular basis. But the touching bases paradigm ignores the reality of their powerful synergy. It's where these four needs overlap that we find true inner balance, deep fulfillment, and joy. The key to the fire within is our spiritual need to leave a legacy.

We may have important roles at work, in the family, in the community, or in other areas of life. Roles represent responsibilities, relationships, and areas of contribution. Much of our pain in life comes from the sense that we're succeeding in one role at the expense of other, possibly even more important roles. We may be doing great as vice president of the company, but not doing well at all as a parent or spouse. A clear set of roles provides a natural framework to create order and balance. If you have a mission statement, your roles will grow out of it. Balance among roles does not simply mean that you're spending time in each role, but that these roles work together for the accomplishment of your mission. Identifying roles gives a sense of the wholeness of quality life that life is more than just a job, or a family, or a particular relationship. It's all of these together. Identifying roles may also highlight \"important, but not urgent\" areas that are currently being neglected. In addition to the roles you've identified, we'd like to suggest a separate and foundational role called \"sharpen the saw\". We treat this as a separate role for two reasons: 1) it's a role that everyone has, and 2) it's foundational for success in every other role. It's also important to realize that all of these roles are not distinct \"departments\" of life. They form a highly interrelated whole. By identifying your roles, you're not trying to break your life down and fit it into neat little boxes on a planning page.

(Thomas Anquinas) Laster und Tugenden (vices and virtues) Tugend = Abeleitet von Tauglichkeit/T\u00fcchtigkeit = Gesundheit der Seele Laster = Abeleitet von schm\u00e4hen, tadeln, verbieten = Abgeleitet von l\u00e4stern = Zur Gewohnheit gewordener Fehler Tugenden -> F\u00fchren zum Gl\u00fcck | Laster versperren den Weg zum Gl\u00fcck Wenn wir danach streben, im Tun, Sprechen, Denken und F\u00fchlen m\u00f6glichst immer tugendhaft zu sein und das Laster und die Leidenschaften zu verringern und zu meiden, kann sich die Tugend zunehmend von einem vereinzelten Ereignis zu einer gewohnheitsm\u00e4\u00dfigen Haltung entwickeln, freiwillig das Gute zu tun. Mittelweg humanistische Liberalismus Ohne Geiz, Habgier und Neid g\u00e4be es kein st\u00e4ndig fortschreitendes Wirtschaftswachstum, keine Triebfeder zur Anh\u00e4ufung von Kapital, w\u00e4hrend sich die Werbung unsere Eitelkeit und Genusssucht eifrig zunutze macht. Dennoch muss man sich angesichts einer immer weiter fortschreitenden Ausbeutung der Natur, der schamlosen Geldgier ganzer Wirtschaftszweige, einer erschreckenden zwischenmenschlichen Entfremdung, der raschen und unbedachten Bereitschaft zur Ehrverletzung im Alltag sowie einer um sich greifenden psychischen Destabilisierung des Individuums fragen: Leben wir nicht vielleicht in einer ausgesprochen dekadenten Gesellschaft, deren Grund\u00fcbel im Fehlen einer Lebensf\u00fchrung besteht, die sich an den Tugenden orientiert und an dem, was wirklich gut ist, statt lediglich an dem, was sich gerade gut anf\u00fchlt? Die westliche Gesellschaft leidet allerdings auch an einer St\u00f6rung. Deren Ursache liegt in der Verwechslung des wirklichen Gl\u00fccks mit einer zwanghaften Suche nach dem Ersatzgl\u00fcck in den Lastern. Die kollektive Gem\u00fctsverfassung, die gro\u00dfe Teile der kapitalistischen Gesellschaft erfasst, zeichnet sich durch einen Verlust an Sinn, Geborgenheit, Lebensfreude und Seelenfrieden aus. autorit\u00e4re Fundamentalismus dogmatischen Vorschriften bez\u00fcglich Sitten und Moral, mit gesellschaftlicher Intoleranz und der Verfolgung Andersdenkender ersetzen. Doppelmoral -> moralisches Handeln aus Egoismus. Tugend- und Laster Basierend auf dem Mittelweg (golden rule Aristotetle): Tugend als Mittelma\u00df zwischen zwei einander entgegengesetzten Lastern. Die Tugend, die dazwischenliegt, bildet einen Ausgleich zu diesen beiden Extremen, nicht unbedingt im Sinne eines Mittelma\u00dfes, das ein wenig von beiden enth\u00e4lt, sondern eher im Sinne einer Synthese, welche die Einseitigkeiten der beiden Laster auf einer h\u00f6heren Ebene aufl\u00f6st. So findet sich zum Beispiel bei einem tugendhaften Menschen nicht so sehr eine gesunde Mischung zwischen w\u00fctendem J\u00e4hzorn und Unempfindlichkeit gegen\u00fcber \u00c4rger; vielmehr ist er in der Lage, mit der Tugend der Geduld und Sanftmut eine Wutreaktion, die automatisch abl\u00e4uft, bewusst zu kontrollieren und den auftretenden \u00c4rger auf eine Weise zu \u00e4u\u00dfern, die andere nicht verletzt. Jede Tugend kann lediglich vorgespielt und geheuchelt sein. Es ist deshalb wichtig, diese Scheintugenden ebenfalls als Variante des Lasters zu identifizieren und doch auch nicht den Fehler zu begehen, zugleich die Tugenden \u00fcber Bord zu werfen. Es gibt eine geheuchelte Tugend und eine echte Tugend. Nur die echten Tugenden sind dazu in der Lage, das entsprechende Laster zu \u00fcberwinden. Verstellung und Heuchelei sind Ausdruck des Lasters der Ungerechtigkeit und Falschheit, womit der Gerechtigkeit und der Wahrhaftigkeit -- \u00e4hnlich wie der Klugheit und der Weisheit -- eine gewisse Sonderstellung vor den anderen Tugenden zukommt. Es ist ein Irrtum zu glauben, die Tugend sei nicht mit der Erf\u00fcllung angeborener Triebe , Instinkte und Bed\u00fcrfnisse vereinbar. Der Unterschied zwischen einem \u00bbHeiligen\u00ab und einem \u00bbS\u00fcnder\u00ab besteht nicht darin, dass der \u00bbHeilige\u00ab sich von allem Triebhaften fernh\u00e4lt, w\u00e4hrend der \u00bbS\u00fcnder\u00ab den nat\u00fcrlichen Leidenschaften freien Lauf l\u00e4sst. Ganz im Gegenteil ist ein tugendhafter Mensch viel besser dazu bef\u00e4higt, seine angeborenen Triebe auf nat\u00fcrliche und ungehemmte Weise anzunehmen und auszudr\u00fccken, als ein Mensch, der tief in die Laster verstrickt ist. Ein tugendhafter Mensch begeht nicht den Fehler, seine Triebe mit denjenigen Dingen zu verwechseln, die ihn wirklich gl\u00fccklich machen. Er kennt den Unterschied zwischen Lust und Gl\u00fcck und k\u00e4me nicht auf die Idee, das Gl\u00fcck in der kurzfristigen Lustbefriedigung zu suchen, was aber nun auch nicht bedeutet, dass die Lust verboten w\u00e4re. Nicht nur sind die Triebe und Instinkte nichts Schlechtes, vielmehr sind sie ganz besonders gut, ja heilig, denn sie entspringen dem Leben, das sich aus der F\u00fclle ergie\u00dft. Das gilt f\u00fcr all jene Instinkte, die Freud als \u00bbLebenstrieb\u00ab oder Eros zusammenfasste. Was aber ist mit dem \u00bbTodestrieb\u00ab (Thanatos), von dessen eigenst\u00e4ndiger Existenz Freud unter dem Eindruck des ungeheuren Vernichtungswillens, der im Ersten Weltkrieg entfesselt wurde, zunehmend \u00fcberzeugt war? Die unzivilisierte Grausamkeit, die oft in kriegerischen Auseinandersetzungen zutage tritt, oder die hartn\u00e4ckige Destruktivit\u00e4t, mit der manche Menschen sich selbst und andere ins Elend st\u00fcrzen, scheinen darauf hinzuweisen, dass nicht alle Triebe im Dienste des Lebens und der Entwicklung stehen. Besitzen die Lebewesen einen angeborenen Instinkt, der auf die eigene Zerst\u00f6rung, die Zerst\u00f6rung anderer oder des Lebens \u00fcberhaupt gerichtet ist? Ist das B\u00f6se real? Was ist das B\u00f6se? \u00bbDas B\u00f6se handelt kraft eines mangelnden Gut\u00ab, schreibt Thomas von Aquin. Das Gute ist dem Licht vergleichbar, das B\u00f6se der Dunkelheit. Die Dunkelheit ist nichts anderes als die Abwesenheit des Lichts und somit eigentlich aus sich selbst heraus nichts. Treffen Licht und Dunkelheit aufeinander, dann wird die Dunkelheit erhellt, nicht das Licht verdunkelt. Wo das Gute ist, kann sich das B\u00f6se nicht halten. Doch wo das Gute fehlt, da breitet das B\u00f6se sich aus. Konkret \u00e4u\u00dfert sich das B\u00f6se als Zusammentreffen von bestimmten Lastern mit entsprechenden Gelegenheiten in der Au\u00dfenwelt, die destruktives Verhalten beg\u00fcnstigen (Krieg) Leidenschaften Die Leidenschaften sind von einer Defizitmotivation bestimmte Triebe, die aus einem Gef\u00fchl der Sinnlosigkeit, der Leere und der Abgeschiedenheit des Ichs heraus entstehen. Sie streben zwar nach einer Verwirklichung der unbefriedigten Sehnsucht und nach einer Wiederherstellung eines Zustandes der Erf\u00fcllung und Zufriedenheit, verhindern dies jedoch gleichzeitig. Emotion vs. Gef\u00fchle (Emotion vs. Feeling) Leidenschaften sind nicht das Gleiche wie Gef\u00fchle. Kant verglich die Gef\u00fchle mit Wasser, das durch einen Damm bricht, die Leidenschaften aber mit einem rei\u00dfenden Strom, der sein Bett tiefer und tiefer gr\u00e4bt. Emotionen sind notwendige und hilfreiche Zust\u00e4nde unseres Organismus, mit denen wir unmittelbar auf Ereignisse reagieren und dadurch zu erkennen verm\u00f6gen, ob etwas gut oder schlecht, angenehm oder unangenehm, wichtig oder unwichtig f\u00fcr uns ist. Dagegen sind die Leidenschaften wie eine Krankheit, die sich tiefer und tiefer in den Organismus hineinfrisst, wenn ihr nicht durch entsprechende Heilmittel entgegengewirkt wird. Werden wir von Leidenschaften gepackt, dann sind wir nicht mehr wir selbst, sondern handeln wie von einer fremden Macht besessen. Rochefoucauld: \u00bbMan mag noch so weit den Leidenschaften entr\u00fcckt erscheinen, man ist ebenso gef\u00e4hrdet, von ihnen weggeschwemmt zu werden, wie zu erkranken, wenn man gesund ist.\u00ab Meist benutzen wir die gleichen Begriffe, um ein Gef\u00fchl und um eine Leidenschaft zu bezeichnen, obschon es sich dabei eigentlich um Unterschiedliches handelt. Die Emotion des Stolzes zum Beispiel, die wir erleben, wenn wir erfolgreich etwas Schwieriges geleistet haben, liegt in der N\u00e4he des Gl\u00fccksgef\u00fchls und stellt eine positive Bewertung dar. Dagegen ist Stolz als Leidenschaft mit dem Laster des Hochmuts verbunden und kann einen Menschen innerlich verzehren, wenn sein Leben ausschlie\u00dflich darum kreist, das eigene Ansehen abzusichern. Es ist wichtig, klar zwischen den hilfreichen Emotionen und den verzehrenden Leidenschaften zu unterscheiden: Erstere gilt es achtsam wahrzunehmen und anzunehmen, auch wenn wir nicht immer ihren ersten Reaktionstendenzen m\u00fcssen, w\u00e4hrend wir Letztere gleich einer Krankheit behandeln, m\u00e4\u00dfigen und verwandeln sollten. Emotion Emotion hingegen ist eine ex-motion - eine Bewegung von innen nach aussen. Manche lesen es auch als e-motion - Energie in Bewegung. Es geht um Ausdruck, Handlung - und auch um Beurteilung. Emotion ist eine Bewertung dessen, was gef\u00fchlt wurde, und wie dies ausgedr\u00fcckt wird: der Tee ist heiss - das ist angenehm. Das Essen ist kalt - das \u00e4rgert mich. Emotion bezeichnet eine Gem\u00fctsbewegung im Sinne eines Affektes. Affekt ist eine besondere Qualit\u00e4t des F\u00fchlens, das durch die bewusste oder unbewusste Wahrnehmung eines Ereignisses oder einer Situation ausgel\u00f6st wird. Das Wahrnehmen geht einher mit physiologischen Ver\u00e4nderungen , spezifischen Kognitionen, subjektivem Gef\u00fchlserleben und reaktivem Sozialverhalten. Im Gegensatz zum Gef\u00fchl sind Emotionen als ein Affekt \u2212 vom agierenden Individuum aus gesehen \u2212 meist nach au\u00dfen gerichtet kurz und intensiv. Der Begriff Affekt betrifft im deutschen Sprachgebiet eine oftmals mit einem Verlust der Handlungskontrolle einhergehende kurzfristige emotionale Reaktion. Physiologische Reaktionen auf Emotionen sind auch mit Messungen neurophysiologischer Parameter nachzuweisen. Es wurden jedoch keine Muster physiologischer Reaktionen gefunden, die eine eindeutige Diagnose einer Emotion erlauben w\u00fcrden. Emotionen: Freude Wut Ekel Furcht Verachtung Traurigkeit \u00dcberraschung Gef\u00fchl Ein Gef\u00fchl ist, was gef\u00fchlt wird, was wahrgenommen wird. Gef\u00fchl ist das, was \u00fcber die Sinnesorgane an Impulsen und Empfindungen in das Bewusstsein hinein tritt. Da ist W\u00e4rme; da ist K\u00e4lte; da ist Hunger; da ist Angst... Ein Gef\u00fchl ist ohne Bewertung. Es wird einfach festgestellt, was da ist, ohne Urteil dar\u00fcber, ob das gut oder schlecht, angenehm oder unangenehm sei. Es ist einfach so. Punkt. F\u00fchlen hat eine weibliche, passive Qualit\u00e4t. Es geht um Aufnehmen, Hingabe und Wahrnehmung. Die Emotion oder der Affekt ist vom F\u00fchlen oder dem Gef\u00fchl zu unterscheiden. So erfassen die Begriffe des F\u00fchlens oder des Gef\u00fchls die unterschiedlichsten psychischen Erfahrungen und Reaktionen die sich beschreiben und damit auch versprachlichen lassen, wie u. a. Liebe, Angst, \u00c4rger, Komik, Ironie sowie Mitleid, Eifersucht, Furcht, Freude und Liebe. Vom Laster zur Tugend Grundvoraussetzung f\u00fcr alles ist Liebe und guter Wille. Von der Unvernunft zur Weisheit (Angemessner Einsatz des Verstandes) \u00dcberma\u00df Mangel Scheintugend Tugend Unvernunft und Verblendung (\u00fcberm\u00e4\u00dfige Selbstischerheit) Einseitigkeit Kurzsichtigkeit Befangenheit Voreingenommenheit Parteilichkeit Unduldsamkeit Borniertheit Intoleranz Vorurteil Dogmatismus Chauvinismus Fanatismus Wahn Dummheit und Nachl\u00e4ssigkeit Unwissenheit Unbesonnenheit \u00dcberst\u00fcrzung Stumpfsinnigkeit Wankelmut Besserwisserei Klugheit und Weisheit Klugheit -> durch Einsicht gewonnenes Wissen das als gut Erkannte zu tun und das als schlecht Erkannte zu lassen \u00dcberlegung - Urteil \u2013 Beschluss Mehrere angemessene langfristige Ziele Rat einholen Alle relevanten Informationen einbeziehen Flexibel Risikobereit und schnell handeln wenn n\u00f6tig Aus Fehlern lernen Gegenmittel: Offenheit Erkenntnisf\u00e4higkeit sapere aude, \u00bbHabe den Mut, dich deines eigenen Verstandes zu bedienen\u00ab. Gegenmittel: Nicht zu bequem, zu eingebildet oder ist intellektuell zu beschr\u00e4nkt, sein um sich in seinen Handlungen durch kluge \u00dcberlegungen leiten zu lassen. Weisheit - Wer weise ist, ist zugleich klug, aber nicht jeder, der klug ist, ist auch weise. Wer weise ist, vermag \u00fcber alles richtig zu urteilen. Weisheit beruht auf Erkenntnis und guten Willen. Weisheit ist ein vollkom-menes Zusammenspiel zwischen Geist und Charakter, zwischen Wissen und Tun. Voraussetzung f\u00fcr Weisheit: Abwesenheit von Laster und Leidenschaft Wissbegierde Freude am Lernen (Anwenden) Kreativit\u00e4t Geistige Offenheit Demut Der Mensch ist f\u00e4hig zur Einsicht. Durch den Intellekt gehen wir \u00fcber reine Sinnest\u00e4tigkeit hinaus und sehen in das innere Wesen der Dinge hinein. Der Verstand bef\u00e4higt, den eigenen Standpunkt zu verlassen und einen anderen einzunehmen (zu verstehen). Die intellektuellen F\u00e4higkeiten verhelfen dazu, eigene Absichten mit den vermeintlichen Erwartungen anderer zu vergleichen, und erlauben so, das Gegen\u00fcber zu beeinflussen. Der Intellekt bef\u00e4higt, Impulse aufzuschieben. Ohne den Verstand w\u00fcrden wir einzig aus der unmittelbaren Empfindung heraus leben. Vernunft: Den Verstand f\u00fcr das zu benutzen was (langfristig) zu meinem (und meiner Mitmenschen) besten Wohl f\u00fchrt. Der Mensch ist dann vern\u00fcnftig, wenn seine verschiedenen psychischen Kr\u00e4fte und F\u00e4higkeiten geregelt zusammenspielen und auf die Verwirklichung eines h\u00f6heren Ziels und einer gesunden, f\u00f6rderlichen Entwicklung ausgerichtet sind. Verstand und Vernunft sind somit nicht das Gleiche. Der Verstand als Teilaspekt der psychischen F\u00e4higkeiten l\u00e4sst sich sowohl vern\u00fcnftig als auch unvern\u00fcnftig gebrauchen.

Warum? T\u00e4ter wollen keine Gerechtigkeit wollen oder bedenken die Folgen ihrer Taten nicht. Gerechtigkeit ohne Liebe kann in Grausamkeit enden. \u00f6ffentlich beschimpften hinter dem R\u00fccken reden verspotten Physisches verletzen Stehlen Betr\u00fcgen Gewissenslosigkeit Scheinheiligkeit und Spie\u00dfertum Gerechtigkeit und Wahrhaft Nicht nur nach eigenen Bed\u00fcrfnissen handeln sonder bewusst sein, dass jedes Gesch\u00f6pf bestimmte Rechte besitzt.

Gerechtigkeit: Ausgleichende: Beziehungen einzelner zueinander Austeilende: Beziehungen des sozialen Ganzen zu den einzelnen (Staat) Gesetzliche: Beziehungen der einzelnen zum sozialen Ganzen Freundlichkeit, Dankbarkeit, Freigebigkeit, Fairness, Respekt gegen\u00fcber den Eltern Falscheit -> T\u00e4uschung, L\u00fcgen, Heuchlei, Prahlerei, Manipulation, Hinterhalt, Verrat, Verlogenheit, List, Unaufrichtig gegen\u00fcber sich selbst. Die Warheit wird erkannt aber absichtlich verdreht. Sich selbst etwas vormachen. Wahrhaftigkeit -> Ehrlichkeit Der \u00e4u\u00dfere Ausdruck entspricht dem inneren Sein -> Authentizit\u00e4t. Umgekehrt bedeutet authentisch zu leben jedoch nicht, dass man alles, was man innerlich erlebt, ungefiltert nach au\u00dfen kommuniziert. Ein wahrhafter Mensch kann nicht l\u00fcgen, weil er nicht irgendetwas anderes sein kann, als er ist. Pers\u00f6nliche Integrit\u00e4t: Handeln basierend auf Werten (Idealen) Zu \u00dcberzeugungen stehen Andere mit Respekt Keine Falschheit Rechtes Reden und Handeln Vom Hochmut zur Demut \u00dcberma\u00df Mangel Scheintugend Tugend Hochmut (Arroganz) und Stolz Beide sind anma\u00dfend, arrogant und \u00fcberheblich. Hochmut -> unkluge Fehleinsch\u00e4tzung des eigenen Seins und K\u00f6nnens. Stolz -> eigenen Vorz\u00fcge werden richtig erkannt, doch auf unkluge und ungerechte Weise benutzt. Schwer zu beurteilen, ob jemand zu Recht auf einen Vorzug stolz ist oder ob er diesen nur hochm\u00fctig vorspielt. Durch ein betont \u00bbcooles\u00ab Gehabe (rar machen), wird versucht, sich selbst und die eigene Referenzgruppe als au\u00dfergew\u00f6hnlich darzustellen. Ansicht, das Gute komme aus einem selbst Glauben, das von Gott Gegebene erhalte man aufgrund eigener Verdienste Prahlerei, etwas zu besitzen, das man gar nicht hat Anschein, den man sich selbst gibt: im Streben nach dem eigenen Vorrang Selbstverachtung, Unterw\u00fcrfigket Bescheidenheit und Demut befreien und l\u00f6sen ruhige, zufriedene Gef\u00fchle aus. Unterw\u00fcrfigkeit dagegen f\u00fchrt zu Anspannung, zu Scham und Frustration. Wer sich nie zutraut, offen zu seiner Meinung zu stehen, seine W\u00fcnsche zu \u00e4u\u00dfern, f\u00fcr seine Bed\u00fcrfnisse einzustehen oder sich bei Ungerechtigkeiten zur Wehr zu setzen , erstickt den nat\u00fcrlichen Impuls des Ichs, seine eigenen Grenzen zu wahren. Falsche Bescheidenheit Wenn jemand bescheiden feststellt, Ehre und Lob w\u00e4ren ihm nicht wichtig, ein kleines Wort des Dankes w\u00fcrde schon gen\u00fcgen, verr\u00e4t dieser als Bescheidenheit getarnte entt\u00e4uschte Wunsch nach Anerkennung, dass sich dieser Mensch in seinem Hochmut darin gef\u00e4llt, innerlich auf all die Undankbaren hinabzublicken. Demut/Bescheidenheit und Seelengr\u00f6\u00dfe Wahre Demut erwartet weder Lohn noch Dank, denn sie geschieht aus Freude und Liebe, die sich selbst Lohn genug sind. Demut: Sich nicht aufblasen Zugeben dass man sich irren kann wissen, dass man die meisten Gaben, als unverdientes Geschenk erhalten hat nicht zu eingebildet, um den Anteil anderer an ihren Verdiensten dankbar anzuerkennen glauben nicht, dass sie ein gr\u00f6\u00dferes St\u00fcck des Kuchens verdienten als andere, nur weil sie sich mehr anstrengen oder besser aussehen Eine andere Strategie, sich einen Vorrang zu sichern, w\u00e4hlt derjenige, der versucht, andere offen herabzusetzen, sie zu kritisieren, Eitelkeit -> \u00fcbertriebenen Sorge um die eigenen Vorz\u00fcge. W\u00e4hrend der Eitle \u00e4u\u00dfere Ehrenzeichen leidenschaftlich begehrt, der Hochm\u00fctige sie r\u00fccksichtslos fordert, verschm\u00e4ht sie der Stolze Ehrgeiz -> Im Sinne von Gier nach Ehre T\u00f6chtern der Ruhmsucht Unfolgsamkeit Prahlerei Heuchelei Zanksucht Rechthaberei Gro\u00dfsinnigkeit -> sich aufgrund der eigener Gaben gro\u00dfer Dinge f\u00fcr w\u00fcrdig halten. Sie sch\u00e4tzt andere dann gering ein, wenn sie scheinbar keinerlei Gaben besitzen oder diese nicht nutzen. Demut -> sich selbst in Anbetracht der eigenen Unzul\u00e4nglichkeiten gering sch\u00e4tzen und andere wegen der ihnen verliehenen Gaben hoch. Seelengr\u00f6\u00dfe verhindert es, dass die Demut in Selbstverachtung und Unterw\u00fcrfigkeit abgleitet, w\u00e4hrend die Demut verhindert, dass sich die Seelengr\u00f6\u00dfe zu Hochmut und Stolz aufbl\u00e4ht. Nur ein hochsinniger dem\u00fctiger Mensch ist v\u00f6llig frei sowohl von den Leidenschaften der \u00dcberheblichkeit wie auch vom Laster der Selbsterniedrigung. Er erkennt seine eigene W\u00fcrde wie auch die W\u00fcrde anderer an, ohne sich selbst oder andere zu \u00fcberh\u00f6hen. Demut macht es m\u00f6glich, ein sicheres Fundament zu bauen, auf dem wir realistisch und entsprechend unseren tats\u00e4chlichen F\u00e4higkeiten und Begrenzungen wachsen k\u00f6nnen. Dazu geh\u00f6rt die Bereitschaft, die verschiedenen Masken, in die sich die Pers\u00f6nlichkeit gerne h\u00fcllt, abzulegen, die falschen Ideale, an denen wir uns st\u00e4ndig ausrichten, fallen zu lassen und uns auch den Schattenseiten und den abgelehnten Selbstanteilen zuzuwenden. Dem\u00fctig m\u00fcssen wir lernen, uns so zu sehen, wie wir sind, und nicht so, wie wir gerne sein m\u00f6chten. Eigennutz abzulegen macht es m\u00f6glich, anderen Menschen freiwillig und mit Freuden zu dienen, nicht aus feiger Unterw\u00fcrfigkeit, sondern aus Achtung und Liebe. Wir m\u00fcssen uns nicht mehr mit anderen vergleichen und nicht mehr abw\u00e4gen, wer den gr\u00f6\u00dferen Nutzen davontr\u00e4gt. Den eigenen Nutzen d\u00fcrfen wir getrost vergessen, wenn wir zufrieden und mit dem erf\u00fcllt sind, was wir sind und haben. Die Demut macht es auch leichter, anderen zu vergeben. Wir m\u00fcssen nicht mehr stolz an unserer Version der Wahrheit festhalten und ben\u00f6tigen keine Nahrung f\u00fcr den Hochmut, indem wir uns trotzig im Recht wissen wollen. Demut Exkurs: Die zw\u00f6lf Stufen der Demut Selbstlosigkeit zu erlernen ist eine lebenslange Herausforderung. Der Begr\u00fcnder des abendl\u00e4ndischen M\u00f6nchstums, Benedikt von Nursia, beschreibt im siebten Kapitel seiner Regel zw\u00f6lf Stufen der Demut, Die ersten Schritte in der Entwicklung der Demut beziehen sich somit auf die richtige spirituelle Verankerung. Je h\u00f6her wir steigen, desto mehr verk\u00f6rpert sich die Demut auch bis hinab ins Leibliche. 1. Gottesfurcht: Auf der ersten Stufe soll der M\u00f6nch jederzeit daran denken, was Gott befohlen hat, insbesondere sich vor der b\u00f6sen Begierde h\u00fcten. Damit sind all die Laster und Leidenschaften gemeint, welche die Seele verdunkeln und von Gottes Gegenwart trennen. Die Gottesfurcht ist somit nichts anders als unbedingte Liebe zu Gott, wozu die St\u00e4rke notwendig ist, stets das Gute zu tun und das B\u00f6se zu meiden. 2. Willenlosigkeit: Auf der zweiten Stufe soll man den eigenen Willen nicht lieben und sich nicht in der Befriedigung seiner W\u00fcnsche gefallen . Statt eifrig immer neue Ziele zu verfolgen, die nur dem eigenen Stolz dienen, erm\u00f6glicht das Loslassen der aktiven Willenst\u00e4tigkeit eine \u00d6ffnung f\u00fcr das reale Leben, das gr\u00f6\u00dfer und sch\u00f6ner ist, als sich das kleine Ich ertr\u00e4umen k\u00f6nnte. 3. Gehorsam: Gehorsam im spirituellen Sinn bedeutet die F\u00e4higkeit, auf die innere Stimme zu horchen. Der Gehorsam erm\u00f6glicht es, dass dasjenige, das klein ist, sich demjenigen unterordnet, das gro\u00df ist. Dadurch wird der Hochmut unm\u00f6glich gemacht, denn dieser beruht auf einer Verwechslung des Kleinen mit dem Gro\u00dfen. Wir \u00f6ffnen uns f\u00fcr die hilfreiche F\u00fchrung durch andere Menschen, die auf dem Pfad der Demut vielleicht schon weiter vorangeschritten sind. 4. Geduld: Die vierte Stufe der Demut erm\u00f6glicht es, widrige Umst\u00e4nde geduldig anzunehmen, sie als notwendige Pr\u00fcfungen zu verstehen und sogar still und selbstbeherrscht auszuharren, wenn einem Unrecht getan wurde. Ohne zu ermatten oder uns zu entziehen, entwickeln wir die F\u00e4higkeit zur geduldigen Akzeptanz, indem wir versuchen, den Wert aller Ereignisse zu ergr\u00fcnden, auch der unangenehmen und schmerzhaften. 5. Wahrhaftigkeit: Benedikt empfiehlt den M\u00f6nchen, \u00bballe schlimmen Gedanken, die im Herzen aufsteigen, und das im Verborgenen begangene B\u00f6se\u00ab dem\u00fctig ihrem Abt zu bekennen. Statt dass wir uns selbst etwas vormachen und anderen etwas vorspielen, sind wir bereit, ehrlich unsere Unzul\u00e4nglichkeiten anzuschauen und uns stets zu fragen, ob wir Unrecht getan haben. Indem wir unsere M\u00e4ngel einer Person des Vertrauens offen mitteilen, verstecken wir uns nicht, sondern entwickeln den Mut zur Authentizit\u00e4t und Integrit\u00e4t. 6. Bescheidenheit: Auf der sechsten Stufe der Demut begegnet uns das, was der Begriff der Bescheidenheit im Kern bedeutet, n\u00e4mlich dass wir uns mit dem \u00bbAllerniedrigsten und Geringsten\u00ab zufriedengeben . Benedikt hatte hier nicht eine \u00e4ngstliche Selbstbeschr\u00e4nkung im Sinn. Es geht vielmehr darum, seinen ma\u00dflosen Egoismus zur\u00fcckzunehmen und sich nicht zu scheuen, auch kleine, glanzlose Arbeiten ohne Aussicht auf Ruhm zufrieden und heiter auszuf\u00fchren. Auch niedrige Arbeiten k\u00f6nnen Spa\u00df machen. Auch einfache Lebensverh\u00e4ltnisse k\u00f6nnen begl\u00fccken. So stellt sich langsam die F\u00e4higkeit zur heiteren Gen\u00fcgsamkeit ein. 7. Selbstlosigkeit: Hier entwickelt sich die F\u00e4higkeit, seine ganze ichbezogene Pers\u00f6nlichkeit mit ihrem Anspruch auf Durchsetzung, Kontrolle und Macht loszulassen . Das Ich verzichtet auf jegliche Anspruchshaltung sowie auf Verteidigung . Benedikt spricht von der tiefen \u00dcberzeugung des Herzens, der Letzte und Geringste unter den Menschen zu sein. Es geht hier nicht darum, alte Muster der Selbstabwertung zu verfestigen, sondern sich von einschr\u00e4nkenden Selbst-Definitionen zu l\u00f6sen, nicht zuletzt auch von der irrigen Meinung, keine Liebe zu verdienen. 8. Lernbereitschaft: Die achte Stufe der Demut hat wieder mit dem Gehorsam zu tun, jetzt aber im Zusammenleben mit anderen Menschen und gegen\u00fcber H\u00f6herstehenden. Im Leben eines M\u00f6nches bezieht sich das nach Benedikt auf die gemeinsame Klosterregel und auf das Beispiel der \u00e4lteren Br\u00fcder. Es geht um die F\u00e4higkeit und den Willen, von denjenigen zu lernen, die mehr wissen und erlebt haben als ich, die weiser und dem\u00fctiger sind. Dies schlie\u00dft auch die Bereitschaft ein, sich f\u00fcr neue und zun\u00e4chst vielleicht ungewohnte Dinge zu \u00f6ffnen, anstatt alles immer besser zu wissen und nur das h\u00f6ren und lernen zu wollen, was man ohnehin schon wei\u00df. 9. Schweigen: Auf der neunten Stufe empfiehlt Benedikt den M\u00f6nchen, ihre Zunge zu bez\u00e4hmen und nicht zu reden, bis man ihnen eine Frage stellt. Wer soll denn da noch fragen, wenn alle schweigen, mag man sich vielleicht wundern! Ich verstehe diese Haltung des Schweigens einerseits als spirituelle \u00dcbung, sich von der st\u00e4ndig kommentierenden und alles besser wissenden Stimme des urteilenden Verstandes zu distanzieren und still zu werden, um die leise Stimme des Herzens besser zu h\u00f6ren. Zugleich f\u00fchrt das Schweigen im zwischenmenschlichen Verkehr dazu, dass man sich mit Urteilen erst einmal zur\u00fcckh\u00e4lt, um m\u00f6glichst unvoreingenommen hinzuh\u00f6ren. Wenn ich mich nicht wehre und wenn ich niemanden bewerte, dann muss oft auch gar nichts mehr gesagt werden. Aus dem Schweigen heraus kann dann etwas ganz anderes gesagt werden, als wenn man gleich losreden w\u00fcrde. Schweigen erm\u00f6glicht die wohlbedachte, demutsvolle Rede (siehe Stufe 11). 10. Ernsthaftigkeit: Immer mehr f\u00fchren die Stufen der Demut bis hinein in die k\u00f6rperliche Existenz. Auf der zehnten Stufe r\u00e4t Benedikt den M\u00f6nchen, nicht schnell und gern zum Lachen bereit zu sein. Hier entsteht vielleicht der gr\u00f6\u00dfte Widerstand gegen Benedikts Anleitungen. Lachen ist doch nichts Schlechtes. Lachen ist gesund! Trotzdem ist Benedikts Zur\u00fcckhaltung gegen\u00fcber dem Lachen nicht unberechtigt, denn nicht wenige Gelegenheiten, bei denen wir lachen, gehen auf Kosten anderer. Jemand schaut komisch drein, wirkt unbeholfen, stellt eine dumme Frage, f\u00fchrt sich t\u00f6lpelhaft auf. Das finden wir zum Schreien. Die meisten Witze kommen nicht ohne eine Kategorie dummer Menschen aus, zu denen niemand geh\u00f6ren will. Man muss leider ern\u00fcchtert feststellen, dass ein gro\u00dfer Teil unseres Humors ungerecht und dumm ist, und vielfach lachen wir am lautesten, wenn wir betrunken sind. Das L\u00e4rmende, Gr\u00f6lende und Johlende des dummen Humors ist mit der Demut nicht vereinbar. Nur eine ruhige, ernsthafte Haltung macht es m\u00f6glich, dass die Demut auch bis in den K\u00f6rper hinein vordringen kann. Aus der stillen Ernsthaftigkeit und Tiefsinnigkeit heraus kann dann aber durchaus Humor entstehen, und es darf auch lautes, herzhaftes Lachen ert\u00f6nen. Es ist dies ein ganz anderer, feinf\u00fchligerer Humor, Ausdruck einer heiteren Seele und eines gel\u00f6sten Leibes. 11. Ruhige Rede: Die elfte Stufe der Demut kn\u00fcpft daran an und besch\u00e4ftigt sich mit der Ruhe im K\u00f6rper, insbesondere in der Stimme. Benedikt empfiehlt eine ruhige, bescheidene Rede und dass man nur wenig und wohlbedacht sprechen soll. Statt loszul\u00e4rmen, drauflos zu plappern und pausenlos zu schnattern, verbreitet der dem\u00fctige Mensch mit seiner Rede eine Stimmung um sich herum, die andere in die Stille und in die Demut einl\u00e4dt . Der bekannte Benediktinerm\u00f6nch Anselm Gr\u00fcn beschreibt in seinem Buch Herzensruhe, wie er in den siebziger Jahren oft Vortr\u00e4gen von Karlfried Graf D\u00fcrckheim lauschte und wie es dadurch in ihm ganz ruhig wurde. \u00bbNach einigen Vortr\u00e4gen kannte ich mehr oder weniger den Inhalt. Ich konnte mir denken, was er da in etwa sagen werde. Aber das war nicht so wichtig. Von seinem Sprechen ging etwas aus, das in mir Ruhe erzeugte.\u00ab 12. Verneigung: Schlie\u00dflich verwandelt die Demut auf der zw\u00f6lften Stufe auch die K\u00f6rperhaltung und die Bewegungen. Weil aus der urspr\u00fcnglichen Gottesfurcht nun Gottesliebe geworden ist, die sich nicht anders \u00e4u\u00dfern kann als demutsvoll, muss sich der K\u00f6rper nicht mehr verkrampfen und anders darstellen, als er eigentlich ist. Es ist vielleicht nicht notwendig, dass man st\u00e4ndig demutsvoll das Haupt neigt, wie Benedikt den M\u00f6nchen r\u00e4t, denn die Demut ist durchaus mit einem aufrechten Gang vereinbar. Als bewusste Geste und \u00dcbung kann aber das Verneigen des Hauptes noch tiefer in die Demut hineinf\u00fchren. Indem ich mich vor allem, was gr\u00f6\u00dfer ist als ich, verneige, kann ich alles geduldig annehmen und bin vollkommen zufrieden. Das Sich-Verneigen in Demut als innere Grundhaltung des gesamten Lebens f\u00fchrt mit der Zeit zu einer vollkommenen Entspannung im K\u00f6rper, die zugleich von Energie und Lebendigkeit erf\u00fcllt ist. Seelengr\u00f6\u00dfe Selbstwert Optimismums Hoffnung Selbstvertrauen, Vertauen darauf, dass man etwas beeinflussen kann Zielorientierung (Realismus, Energie, Mut) Vom Neid zur Dankbarkeit \u00dcberma\u00df Mangel Scheintugend Tugend Neid und Eifersucht Verbunden mit Vorstellungen des Ungen\u00fcgens und des Mangels Neid -> Die Person oder Gruppe, mit der ein Neider sich vergleicht, kommt besser weg als er selbst. Der Begriff Missgunst bezeichnet die weniger schlimme Form des Neides. Bei der schlimmeren Form sprechen wir von Schadenfreude. Selbst\u00fcberh\u00f6hung Moralische Entr\u00fcstung Man emp\u00f6rt sich nicht deshalb \u00fcber die Lasterhaftigkeit anderer Menschen, weil man sich aufrichtig um ihr Wohlergehen sorgt oder weil man selbst ein so leuchtendes Beispiel f\u00fcr Tugendhaftigkeit abgibt, sondern um dem verzehrenden Neid oder der nagenden Eifersucht Luft zu verschaffen. \u00bbMoralische Entr\u00fcstung ist Eifersucht mit einem Heiligenschein\u00ab Dankbarkeit und Gro\u00dfherzigkeit (G\u00fcte) Der Grund f\u00fcr die Herzensgr\u00f6\u00dfe g\u00fctiger Menschen ist ihre Dankbarkeit. Gro\u00dfherzige Menschen schauen nicht auf das, was sie nicht besitzen oder nicht sind, sondern sind zutiefst f\u00fcr alles Gute dankbar, das ihnen geschenkt wird. Ein dankbarer Mensch vergisst nie, was ihm Gutes widerf\u00e4hrt. Er zehrt davon, wenn die Zeiten einmal schlecht werden, und er bl\u00fcht auf, wenn er sich die vielen kleinen und gro\u00dfen Geschenke vergegenw\u00e4rtigt, die das Leben ihm t\u00e4glich bereitet. Um den Neid wirklich aufzul\u00f6sen, ist es unumg\u00e4nglich, sich ehrlich einzugestehen, dass man neidisch ist. Indem man bei sich selbst erforscht, um welche Eigenschaften oder G\u00fcter man andere am meisten beneidet, l\u00e4sst sich herausfinden, in welchen Bereichen das Selbstwertgef\u00fchl am st\u00e4rksten angegriffen ist. Eine schonungslose Analyse des eigenen Neides kann dazu beitragen, sich mit der Zeit immer mehr vom Neid zu l\u00f6sen und eine Haltung der Dankbarkeit einzunehmen. Der Weg von einem missg\u00fcnstigen Dasein zur Dankbarkeit f\u00fchrt \u00fcber die Akzeptanz eigener Gef\u00fchle des Neides oder der Eifersucht. Eifersucht -> \u00bbEifersucht ist eine Leidenschaft, die mit Eifer sucht, was Leiden schafft.\u00ab Als Emotion erleben wir Eifersucht, wenn wir meinen, seitens einer Drittperson nicht gen\u00fcgend Aufmerksamkeit oder Zuneigung zu erhalten, w\u00e4hrend scheinbar eine andere Person, von der wir ausgestochen werden, in einem h\u00f6heren Ma\u00dfe durch die Drittperson beg\u00fcnstigt wird. Ein Leben, das sich am Sein statt am Haben ausrichtet, betrachtet das Dasein stets vom Standpunkt der Ewigkeit aus \u2013 im Wissen darum, dass jeglicher Besitz wieder verloren geht, es sei denn, der Besitz kann im eigenen Herzen aufbewahrt werden. Die Dankbarkeit \u00fcber das eigene Dasein f\u00fchrt zum Wunsch, anderen Menschen mit N\u00e4chstenliebe, mit Mitgef\u00fchl, Freundschaft, Sympathie und ohne Vorurteile oder Egoismus zu begegnen. Je mehr man sich durch die Dankbarkeit verwandeln l\u00e4sst, desto st\u00e4rker w\u00e4chst der Impuls, g\u00fctig und gro\u00dfherzig zu sein. Man erlebt sich als jemanden, der vom Leben reichlich beschenkt wird, weshalb man auch andere beschenken m\u00f6chte. Vom J\u00e4hzorn zur Sanftmut \u00dcberma\u00df Mangel Scheintugend Tugend J\u00e4hzorn und Grausamkeit J\u00e4hzorn -> aggressiven Gef\u00fchlsausbruch, der pl\u00f6tzlich und unvermittelt (\u00bbj\u00e4h\u00ab) aus kleinstem Anlass gegen\u00fcber Personen oder Dingen auftritt. Streiterei \u00c4rger, Wut, Zorn Rache Beschimpfung, L\u00e4rmerei Absto\u00dfung Fluchen Unfreundlichkeit oder Unvertr\u00e4glichkeit. Feindschaft, Hass, Rachsucht, Grausamkeit -> Wer hasst, verabscheut nicht nur einen Menschen, sondern m\u00f6chte ihm auch schaden. Hass entspringt oft anderen Lastern, insbesondere dem Neid, dem gekr\u00e4nkten Ehrgeiz oder der Eifersucht. Ohne vorangehende Liebe kann Hass n\u00e4mlich gar nicht auftreten. Aggressionshemmung, Unerz\u00fcrnbarkeit Falsche Friedfertigkeit gespielte Freundlichkeit Sanftmut (Milde) und Freundlichkeit Friedfertig Empathie Respekt Vergebung Gelassenheit Ruhe Friedfertigkeit <> Schw\u00e4che Aggressivit\u00e4t <> St\u00e4rke Freundlichkeit -> ein freundlicher Mensch ist allen gegen\u00fcber r\u00fccksichtsvoll, taktvoll und h\u00f6flich, auch gegen\u00fcber Personen, die er nicht mag. Zorn in Sanftmut umwandeln Bei der Verwandlung des Zornes ist es ganz besonders wichtig, seine eigenen Erlebnisse und Reaktionen ganz genau und m\u00f6glichst unvoreingenommen zu beobachten. Hass und Rachsucht sind oft der traurige Endpunkt einer langen Entwicklung. J\u00e4hzornigen Reaktionen geht praktisch immer ein leiser, unterdr\u00fcckter \u00c4rger voraus. Diese erste leise \u00c4rgerreaktion sollte man als Signal daf\u00fcr wahrnehmen und sch\u00e4tzen lernen, dass man sich in seinem Respekt herabgesetzt, in seinen Grenzen verletzt f\u00fchlt und eine bestimmte \u00c4u\u00dferung oder Handlung als ungerecht erlebt. Wenn es gelingt, diese fr\u00fche, oft berechtigte \u00c4rgerreaktion wahrzunehmen und das Gef\u00fchl auf angemessene Weise auszudr\u00fccken, nicht aggressiv und verletzend, sondern selbstbewusst und respektvoll, dann kann ein weiteres Aufschaukeln unterbrochen und eine Zornesexplosion verhindert werden. Tats\u00e4chlich stellt der \u00c4rger oft eine gesunde Reaktion auf \u00dcbergriffe und Verletzungen dar, weitaus angemessener als ein niedergeschlagener und \u00e4ngstlicher R\u00fcckzug.

Mit der Selbstbeobachtung in Situationen, in denen man sich \u00e4rgert, sollte eine Art Selbstgespr\u00e4ch einhergehen, indem man sich Fragen wie die folgenden stellt: Was macht mich am meisten w\u00fctend? Wieso bin ich gerade auf diese Person zornig? Was verletzt mich so sehr? G\u00e4be es eine M\u00f6glichkeit, meine negativen Gef\u00fchle angemessen auszudr\u00fccken? Auch bei einer \u00fcberschie\u00dfenden, j\u00e4hzornigen Reaktion laufen Selbstgespr\u00e4che ab, nur leider automatisiert und mit dem immer gleichen Ergebnis, dass man sich als respektlos behandeltes Opfer erlebt. Es geht nun darum, diesen Dialog mit sich selbst bewusst neu zu gestalten. Statt dass wir weiter \u00d6l ins Feuer gie\u00dfen und uns in den Zorn hineinsteigern, lernen wir, uns selbst zu beruhigen und Kontrolle \u00fcber die Situation zu erlangen.

Zwischen den beiden Polen des Geizes und der Verschwendungssucht ist die Freigebigkeit anzusiedeln. Der mit dieser Tugend Gesegnete versteht es, das Geld klug zu nutzen. Dazu geh\u00f6rt auch, mit anderen zu teilen und sich auf diese Weise gegenseitig Sicherheiten zu gew\u00e4hren. Ein freigebiger Mensch ist sich bewusst, dass sich das Rad des Schicksals best\u00e4ndig dreht. Wer im Moment oben ist und vieles besitzt, kann bald auch wieder alles verlieren und auf Zuwendungen angewiesen sein. Ein freigebiger Mensch sieht sein Hab und Gut nur als geliehen an. Er ist dankbar daf\u00fcr, dass er es zeitweilig nutzen darf. Sogar wenn er nur wenig besitzt, denkt er immer noch daran, was er anderen geben kann. Geld und andere wertvolle Dinge bewusst spenden und verschenken, nicht wahl- und ziellos, sondern so, dass wirklich etwas Gutes und Sinnvolles bewirkt wird. Indem wir die Distanziertheit aufgeben, uns auf jeden Augenblick neu einlassen und nicht \u00bban unserem Revier festhalten\u00ab (Maitri), erwerben wir eine Freiheit, die Dinge loszulassen, aufzugeben, zu entsagen und somit wahrhaft gro\u00dfz\u00fcgig zu leben.

Die Tugend, die dazwischenliegt, bildet einen Ausgleich zu diesen beiden Extremen, nicht unbedingt im Sinne eines Mittelma\u00dfes, das ein wenig von beiden enth\u00e4lt, sondern eher im Sinne einer Synthese, welche die Einseitigkeiten der beiden Laster auf einer h\u00f6heren Ebene aufl\u00f6st. So findet sich zum Beispiel bei einem tugendhaften Menschen nicht so sehr eine gesunde Mischung zwischen w\u00fctendem J\u00e4hzorn und Unempfindlichkeit gegen\u00fcber \u00c4rger; vielmehr ist er in der Lage, mit der Tugend der Geduld und Sanftmut eine Wutreaktion, die automatisch abl\u00e4uft, bewusst zu kontrollieren und den auftretenden \u00c4rger auf eine Weise zu \u00e4u\u00dfern, die andere nicht verletzt. Jede Tugend kann lediglich vorgespielt und geheuchelt sein. Es ist deshalb wichtig, diese Scheintugenden ebenfalls als Variante des Lasters zu identifizieren und doch auch nicht den Fehler zu begehen, zugleich die Tugenden \u00fcber Bord zu werfen. Es gibt eine geheuchelte Tugend und eine echte Tugend. Nur die echten Tugenden sind dazu in der Lage, das entsprechende Laster zu \u00fcberwinden. Verstellung und Heuchelei sind Ausdruck des Lasters der Ungerechtigkeit und Falschheit, womit der Gerechtigkeit und der Wahrhaftigkeit -- \u00e4hnlich wie der Klugheit und der Weisheit -- eine gewisse Sonderstellung vor den anderen Tugenden zukommt. Es ist ein Irrtum zu glauben, die Tugend sei nicht mit der Erf\u00fcllung angeborener Triebe , Instinkte und Bed\u00fcrfnisse vereinbar. Der Unterschied zwischen einem \u00bbHeiligen\u00ab und einem \u00bbS\u00fcnder\u00ab besteht nicht darin, dass der \u00bbHeilige\u00ab sich von allem Triebhaften fernh\u00e4lt, w\u00e4hrend der \u00bbS\u00fcnder\u00ab den nat\u00fcrlichen Leidenschaften freien Lauf l\u00e4sst. Ganz im Gegenteil ist ein tugendhafter Mensch viel besser dazu bef\u00e4higt, seine angeborenen Triebe auf nat\u00fcrliche und ungehemmte Weise anzunehmen und auszudr\u00fccken, als ein Mensch, der tief in die Laster verstrickt ist. Ein tugendhafter Mensch begeht nicht den Fehler, seine Triebe mit denjenigen Dingen zu verwechseln, die ihn wirklich gl\u00fccklich machen. Er kennt den Unterschied zwischen Lust und Gl\u00fcck und k\u00e4me nicht auf die Idee, das Gl\u00fcck in der kurzfristigen Lustbefriedigung zu suchen, was aber nun auch nicht bedeutet, dass die Lust verboten w\u00e4re. Nicht nur sind die Triebe und Instinkte nichts Schlechtes, vielmehr sind sie ganz besonders gut, ja heilig, denn sie entspringen dem Leben, das sich aus der F\u00fclle ergie\u00dft. Das gilt f\u00fcr all jene Instinkte, die Freud als \u00bbLebenstrieb\u00ab oder Eros zusammenfasste.

Besitzen die Lebewesen einen angeborenen Instinkt, der auf die eigene Zerst\u00f6rung, die Zerst\u00f6rung anderer oder des Lebens \u00fcberhaupt gerichtet ist? Ist das B\u00f6se real? Was ist das B\u00f6se? \u00bbDas B\u00f6se handelt kraft eines mangelnden Gut\u00ab, schreibt Thomas von Aquin. Das Gute ist dem Licht vergleichbar, das B\u00f6se der Dunkelheit. Die Dunkelheit ist nichts anderes als die Abwesenheit des Lichts und somit eigentlich aus sich selbst heraus nichts. Treffen Licht und Dunkelheit aufeinander, dann wird die Dunkelheit erhellt, nicht das Licht verdunkelt. Wo das Gute ist, kann sich das B\u00f6se nicht halten. Doch wo das Gute fehlt, da breitet das B\u00f6se sich aus.

Emotionen sind notwendige und hilfreiche Zust\u00e4nde unseres Organismus, mit denen wir unmittelbar auf Ereignisse reagieren und dadurch zu erkennen verm\u00f6gen, ob etwas gut oder schlecht, angenehm oder unangenehm, wichtig oder unwichtig f\u00fcr uns ist. Dagegen sind die Leidenschaften wie eine Krankheit, die sich tiefer und tiefer in den Organismus hineinfrisst, wenn ihr nicht durch entsprechende Heilmittel entgegengewirkt wird. Werden wir von Leidenschaften gepackt, dann sind wir nicht mehr wir selbst, sondern handeln wie von einer fremden Macht besessen.

Die Emotion des Stolzes zum Beispiel, die wir erleben, wenn wir erfolgreich etwas Schwieriges geleistet haben, liegt in der N\u00e4he des Gl\u00fccksgef\u00fchls und stellt eine positive Bewertung dar. Dagegen ist Stolz als Leidenschaft mit dem Laster des Hochmuts verbunden und kann einen Menschen innerlich verzehren, wenn sein Leben ausschlie\u00dflich darum kreist, das eigene Ansehen abzusichern. Es ist wichtig, klar zwischen den hilfreichen Emotionen und den verzehrenden Leidenschaften zu unterscheiden: Erstere gilt es achtsam wahrzunehmen und anzunehmen, auch wenn wir nicht immer ihren ersten Reaktionstendenzen m\u00fcssen, w\u00e4hrend wir Letztere gleich einer Krankheit behandeln, m\u00e4\u00dfigen und verwandeln sollten.","title":"Emotion vs. Gef\u00fchle (Emotion vs. Feeling)"},{"location":"Personal_Development/Innere_MItte/#emotion","text":"Emotion hingegen ist eine ex-motion - eine Bewegung von innen nach aussen.

W\u00e4hrend der Eitle \u00e4u\u00dfere Ehrenzeichen leidenschaftlich begehrt, der Hochm\u00fctige sie r\u00fccksichtslos fordert, verschm\u00e4ht sie der Stolze Ehrgeiz -> Im Sinne von Gier nach Ehre T\u00f6chtern der Ruhmsucht Unfolgsamkeit Prahlerei Heuchelei Zanksucht Rechthaberei Gro\u00dfsinnigkeit -> sich aufgrund der eigener Gaben gro\u00dfer Dinge f\u00fcr w\u00fcrdig halten. Sie sch\u00e4tzt andere dann gering ein, wenn sie scheinbar keinerlei Gaben besitzen oder diese nicht nutzen. Demut -> sich selbst in Anbetracht der eigenen Unzul\u00e4nglichkeiten gering sch\u00e4tzen und andere wegen der ihnen verliehenen Gaben hoch. Seelengr\u00f6\u00dfe verhindert es, dass die Demut in Selbstverachtung und Unterw\u00fcrfigkeit abgleitet, w\u00e4hrend die Demut verhindert, dass sich die Seelengr\u00f6\u00dfe zu Hochmut und Stolz aufbl\u00e4ht. Nur ein hochsinniger dem\u00fctiger Mensch ist v\u00f6llig frei sowohl von den Leidenschaften der \u00dcberheblichkeit wie auch vom Laster der Selbsterniedrigung. Er erkennt seine eigene W\u00fcrde wie auch die W\u00fcrde anderer an, ohne sich selbst oder andere zu \u00fcberh\u00f6hen. Demut macht es m\u00f6glich, ein sicheres Fundament zu bauen, auf dem wir realistisch und entsprechend unseren tats\u00e4chlichen F\u00e4higkeiten und Begrenzungen wachsen k\u00f6nnen. Dazu geh\u00f6rt die Bereitschaft, die verschiedenen Masken, in die sich die Pers\u00f6nlichkeit gerne h\u00fcllt, abzulegen, die falschen Ideale, an denen wir uns st\u00e4ndig ausrichten, fallen zu lassen und uns auch den Schattenseiten und den abgelehnten Selbstanteilen zuzuwenden. Dem\u00fctig m\u00fcssen wir lernen, uns so zu sehen, wie wir sind, und nicht so, wie wir gerne sein m\u00f6chten. Eigennutz abzulegen macht es m\u00f6glich, anderen Menschen freiwillig und mit Freuden zu dienen, nicht aus feiger Unterw\u00fcrfigkeit, sondern aus Achtung und Liebe. Wir m\u00fcssen uns nicht mehr mit anderen vergleichen und nicht mehr abw\u00e4gen, wer den gr\u00f6\u00dferen Nutzen davontr\u00e4gt. Den eigenen Nutzen d\u00fcrfen wir getrost vergessen, wenn wir zufrieden und mit dem erf\u00fcllt sind, was wir sind und haben. Die Demut macht es auch leichter, anderen zu vergeben. Wir m\u00fcssen nicht mehr stolz an unserer Version der Wahrheit festhalten und ben\u00f6tigen keine Nahrung f\u00fcr den Hochmut, indem wir uns trotzig im Recht wissen wollen.","title":"Vom Hochmut zur Demut"},{"location":"Personal_Development/Innere_MItte/#demut","text":"Exkurs: Die zw\u00f6lf Stufen der Demut Selbstlosigkeit zu erlernen ist eine lebenslange Herausforderung. Der Begr\u00fcnder des abendl\u00e4ndischen M\u00f6nchstums, Benedikt von Nursia, beschreibt im siebten Kapitel seiner Regel zw\u00f6lf Stufen der Demut, Die ersten Schritte in der Entwicklung der Demut beziehen sich somit auf die richtige spirituelle Verankerung. Je h\u00f6her wir steigen, desto mehr verk\u00f6rpert sich die Demut auch bis hinab ins Leibliche. 1. Gottesfurcht: Auf der ersten Stufe soll der M\u00f6nch jederzeit daran denken, was Gott befohlen hat, insbesondere sich vor der b\u00f6sen Begierde h\u00fcten. Damit sind all die Laster und Leidenschaften gemeint, welche die Seele verdunkeln und von Gottes Gegenwart trennen. Die Gottesfurcht ist somit nichts anders als unbedingte Liebe zu Gott, wozu die St\u00e4rke notwendig ist, stets das Gute zu tun und das B\u00f6se zu meiden. 2. Willenlosigkeit: Auf der zweiten Stufe soll man den eigenen Willen nicht lieben und sich nicht in der Befriedigung seiner W\u00fcnsche gefallen . Statt eifrig immer neue Ziele zu verfolgen, die nur dem eigenen Stolz dienen, erm\u00f6glicht das Loslassen der aktiven Willenst\u00e4tigkeit eine \u00d6ffnung f\u00fcr das reale Leben, das gr\u00f6\u00dfer und sch\u00f6ner ist, als sich das kleine Ich ertr\u00e4umen k\u00f6nnte. 3. Gehorsam: Gehorsam im spirituellen Sinn bedeutet die F\u00e4higkeit, auf die innere Stimme zu horchen. Der Gehorsam erm\u00f6glicht es, dass dasjenige, das klein ist, sich demjenigen unterordnet, das gro\u00df ist. Dadurch wird der Hochmut unm\u00f6glich gemacht, denn dieser beruht auf einer Verwechslung des Kleinen mit dem Gro\u00dfen. Wir \u00f6ffnen uns f\u00fcr die hilfreiche F\u00fchrung durch andere Menschen, die auf dem Pfad der Demut vielleicht schon weiter vorangeschritten sind. 4. Geduld: Die vierte Stufe der Demut erm\u00f6glicht es, widrige Umst\u00e4nde geduldig anzunehmen, sie als notwendige Pr\u00fcfungen zu verstehen und sogar still und selbstbeherrscht auszuharren, wenn einem Unrecht getan wurde. Ohne zu ermatten oder uns zu entziehen, entwickeln wir die F\u00e4higkeit zur geduldigen Akzeptanz, indem wir versuchen, den Wert aller Ereignisse zu ergr\u00fcnden, auch der unangenehmen und schmerzhaften. 5. Wahrhaftigkeit: Benedikt empfiehlt den M\u00f6nchen, \u00bballe schlimmen Gedanken, die im Herzen aufsteigen, und das im Verborgenen begangene B\u00f6se\u00ab dem\u00fctig ihrem Abt zu bekennen. Statt dass wir uns selbst etwas vormachen und anderen etwas vorspielen, sind wir bereit, ehrlich unsere Unzul\u00e4nglichkeiten anzuschauen und uns stets zu fragen, ob wir Unrecht getan haben. Indem wir unsere M\u00e4ngel einer Person des Vertrauens offen mitteilen, verstecken wir uns nicht, sondern entwickeln den Mut zur Authentizit\u00e4t und Integrit\u00e4t. 6. Bescheidenheit: Auf der sechsten Stufe der Demut begegnet uns das, was der Begriff der Bescheidenheit im Kern bedeutet, n\u00e4mlich dass wir uns mit dem \u00bbAllerniedrigsten und Geringsten\u00ab zufriedengeben . Benedikt hatte hier nicht eine \u00e4ngstliche Selbstbeschr\u00e4nkung im Sinn. Es geht vielmehr darum, seinen ma\u00dflosen Egoismus zur\u00fcckzunehmen und sich nicht zu scheuen, auch kleine, glanzlose Arbeiten ohne Aussicht auf Ruhm zufrieden und heiter auszuf\u00fchren. Auch niedrige Arbeiten k\u00f6nnen Spa\u00df machen. Auch einfache Lebensverh\u00e4ltnisse k\u00f6nnen begl\u00fccken. So stellt sich langsam die F\u00e4higkeit zur heiteren Gen\u00fcgsamkeit ein. 7. Selbstlosigkeit: Hier entwickelt sich die F\u00e4higkeit, seine ganze ichbezogene Pers\u00f6nlichkeit mit ihrem Anspruch auf Durchsetzung, Kontrolle und Macht loszulassen . Das Ich verzichtet auf jegliche Anspruchshaltung sowie auf Verteidigung . Benedikt spricht von der tiefen \u00dcberzeugung des Herzens, der Letzte und Geringste unter den Menschen zu sein. Es geht hier nicht darum, alte Muster der Selbstabwertung zu verfestigen, sondern sich von einschr\u00e4nkenden Selbst-Definitionen zu l\u00f6sen, nicht zuletzt auch von der irrigen Meinung, keine Liebe zu verdienen. 8. Lernbereitschaft: Die achte Stufe der Demut hat wieder mit dem Gehorsam zu tun, jetzt aber im Zusammenleben mit anderen Menschen und gegen\u00fcber H\u00f6herstehenden. Im Leben eines M\u00f6nches bezieht sich das nach Benedikt auf die gemeinsame Klosterregel und auf das Beispiel der \u00e4lteren Br\u00fcder. Es geht um die F\u00e4higkeit und den Willen, von denjenigen zu lernen, die mehr wissen und erlebt haben als ich, die weiser und dem\u00fctiger sind. Dies schlie\u00dft auch die Bereitschaft ein, sich f\u00fcr neue und zun\u00e4chst vielleicht ungewohnte Dinge zu \u00f6ffnen, anstatt alles immer besser zu wissen und nur das h\u00f6ren und lernen zu wollen, was man ohnehin schon wei\u00df. 9. Schweigen: Auf der neunten Stufe empfiehlt Benedikt den M\u00f6nchen, ihre Zunge zu bez\u00e4hmen und nicht zu reden, bis man ihnen eine Frage stellt. Wer soll denn da noch fragen, wenn alle schweigen, mag man sich vielleicht wundern! Ich verstehe diese Haltung des Schweigens einerseits als spirituelle \u00dcbung, sich von der st\u00e4ndig kommentierenden und alles besser wissenden Stimme des urteilenden Verstandes zu distanzieren und still zu werden, um die leise Stimme des Herzens besser zu h\u00f6ren. Zugleich f\u00fchrt das Schweigen im zwischenmenschlichen Verkehr dazu, dass man sich mit Urteilen erst einmal zur\u00fcckh\u00e4lt, um m\u00f6glichst unvoreingenommen hinzuh\u00f6ren. Wenn ich mich nicht wehre und wenn ich niemanden bewerte, dann muss oft auch gar nichts mehr gesagt werden. Aus dem Schweigen heraus kann dann etwas ganz anderes gesagt werden, als wenn man gleich losreden w\u00fcrde. Schweigen erm\u00f6glicht die wohlbedachte, demutsvolle Rede (siehe Stufe 11). 10. Ernsthaftigkeit: Immer mehr f\u00fchren die Stufen der Demut bis hinein in die k\u00f6rperliche Existenz. Auf der zehnten Stufe r\u00e4t Benedikt den M\u00f6nchen, nicht schnell und gern zum Lachen bereit zu sein. Hier entsteht vielleicht der gr\u00f6\u00dfte Widerstand gegen Benedikts Anleitungen. Lachen ist doch nichts Schlechtes. Lachen ist gesund! Trotzdem ist Benedikts Zur\u00fcckhaltung gegen\u00fcber dem Lachen nicht unberechtigt, denn nicht wenige Gelegenheiten, bei denen wir lachen, gehen auf Kosten anderer. Jemand schaut komisch drein, wirkt unbeholfen, stellt eine dumme Frage, f\u00fchrt sich t\u00f6lpelhaft auf. Das finden wir zum Schreien. Die meisten Witze kommen nicht ohne eine Kategorie dummer Menschen aus, zu denen niemand geh\u00f6ren will. Man muss leider ern\u00fcchtert feststellen, dass ein gro\u00dfer Teil unseres Humors ungerecht und dumm ist, und vielfach lachen wir am lautesten, wenn wir betrunken sind. Das L\u00e4rmende, Gr\u00f6lende und Johlende des dummen Humors ist mit der Demut nicht vereinbar. Nur eine ruhige, ernsthafte Haltung macht es m\u00f6glich, dass die Demut auch bis in den K\u00f6rper hinein vordringen kann. Aus der stillen Ernsthaftigkeit und Tiefsinnigkeit heraus kann dann aber durchaus Humor entstehen, und es darf auch lautes, herzhaftes Lachen ert\u00f6nen. Es ist dies ein ganz anderer, feinf\u00fchligerer Humor, Ausdruck einer heiteren Seele und eines gel\u00f6sten Leibes. 11. Ruhige Rede: Die elfte Stufe der Demut kn\u00fcpft daran an und besch\u00e4ftigt sich mit der Ruhe im K\u00f6rper, insbesondere in der Stimme. Benedikt empfiehlt eine ruhige, bescheidene Rede und dass man nur wenig und wohlbedacht sprechen soll. Statt loszul\u00e4rmen, drauflos zu plappern und pausenlos zu schnattern, verbreitet der dem\u00fctige Mensch mit seiner Rede eine Stimmung um sich herum, die andere in die Stille und in die Demut einl\u00e4dt . Der bekannte Benediktinerm\u00f6nch Anselm Gr\u00fcn beschreibt in seinem Buch Herzensruhe, wie er in den siebziger Jahren oft Vortr\u00e4gen von Karlfried Graf D\u00fcrckheim lauschte und wie es dadurch in ihm ganz ruhig wurde. \u00bbNach einigen Vortr\u00e4gen kannte ich mehr oder weniger den Inhalt. Ich konnte mir denken, was er da in etwa sagen werde. Aber das war nicht so wichtig. Von seinem Sprechen ging etwas aus, das in mir Ruhe erzeugte.\u00ab 12. Verneigung: Schlie\u00dflich verwandelt die Demut auf der zw\u00f6lften Stufe auch die K\u00f6rperhaltung und die Bewegungen. Weil aus der urspr\u00fcnglichen Gottesfurcht nun Gottesliebe geworden ist, die sich nicht anders \u00e4u\u00dfern kann als demutsvoll, muss sich der K\u00f6rper nicht mehr verkrampfen und anders darstellen, als er eigentlich ist. Es ist vielleicht nicht notwendig, dass man st\u00e4ndig demutsvoll das Haupt neigt, wie Benedikt den M\u00f6nchen r\u00e4t, denn die Demut ist durchaus mit einem aufrechten Gang vereinbar. Als bewusste Geste und \u00dcbung kann aber das Verneigen des Hauptes noch tiefer in die Demut hineinf\u00fchren. Indem ich mich vor allem, was gr\u00f6\u00dfer ist als ich, verneige, kann ich alles geduldig annehmen und bin vollkommen zufrieden. Das Sich-Verneigen in Demut als innere Grundhaltung des gesamten Lebens f\u00fchrt mit der Zeit zu einer vollkommenen Entspannung im K\u00f6rper, die zugleich von Energie und Lebendigkeit erf\u00fcllt ist.","title":"Demut"},{"location":"Personal_Development/Innere_MItte/#seelengroe","text":"Selbstwert Optimismums Hoffnung Selbstvertrauen, Vertauen darauf, dass man etwas beeinflussen kann Zielorientierung (Realismus, Energie, Mut)","title":"Seelengr\u00f6\u00dfe"},{"location":"Personal_Development/Innere_MItte/#vom-neid-zur-dankbarkeit","text":"\u00dcberma\u00df Mangel Scheintugend Tugend Neid und Eifersucht Verbunden mit Vorstellungen des Ungen\u00fcgens und des Mangels Neid -> Die Person oder Gruppe, mit der ein Neider sich vergleicht, kommt besser weg als er selbst. Der Begriff Missgunst bezeichnet die weniger schlimme Form des Neides. Bei der schlimmeren Form sprechen wir von Schadenfreude. Selbst\u00fcberh\u00f6hung Moralische Entr\u00fcstung Man emp\u00f6rt sich nicht deshalb \u00fcber die Lasterhaftigkeit anderer Menschen, weil man sich aufrichtig um ihr Wohlergehen sorgt oder weil man selbst ein so leuchtendes Beispiel f\u00fcr Tugendhaftigkeit abgibt, sondern um dem verzehrenden Neid oder der nagenden Eifersucht Luft zu verschaffen. \u00bbMoralische Entr\u00fcstung ist Eifersucht mit einem Heiligenschein\u00ab Dankbarkeit und Gro\u00dfherzigkeit (G\u00fcte) Der Grund f\u00fcr die Herzensgr\u00f6\u00dfe g\u00fctiger Menschen ist ihre Dankbarkeit. Gro\u00dfherzige Menschen schauen nicht auf das, was sie nicht besitzen oder nicht sind, sondern sind zutiefst f\u00fcr alles Gute dankbar, das ihnen geschenkt wird. Ein dankbarer Mensch vergisst nie, was ihm Gutes widerf\u00e4hrt. Er zehrt davon, wenn die Zeiten einmal schlecht werden, und er bl\u00fcht auf, wenn er sich die vielen kleinen und gro\u00dfen Geschenke vergegenw\u00e4rtigt, die das Leben ihm t\u00e4glich bereitet. Um den Neid wirklich aufzul\u00f6sen, ist es unumg\u00e4nglich, sich ehrlich einzugestehen, dass man neidisch ist. Indem man bei sich selbst erforscht, um welche Eigenschaften oder G\u00fcter man andere am meisten beneidet, l\u00e4sst sich herausfinden, in welchen Bereichen das Selbstwertgef\u00fchl am st\u00e4rksten angegriffen ist. Eine schonungslose Analyse des eigenen Neides kann dazu beitragen, sich mit der Zeit immer mehr vom Neid zu l\u00f6sen und eine Haltung der Dankbarkeit einzunehmen. Der Weg von einem missg\u00fcnstigen Dasein zur Dankbarkeit f\u00fchrt \u00fcber die Akzeptanz eigener Gef\u00fchle des Neides oder der Eifersucht. Eifersucht -> \u00bbEifersucht ist eine Leidenschaft, die mit Eifer sucht, was Leiden schafft.\u00ab Als Emotion erleben wir Eifersucht, wenn wir meinen, seitens einer Drittperson nicht gen\u00fcgend Aufmerksamkeit oder Zuneigung zu erhalten, w\u00e4hrend scheinbar eine andere Person, von der wir ausgestochen werden, in einem h\u00f6heren Ma\u00dfe durch die Drittperson beg\u00fcnstigt wird. Ein Leben, das sich am Sein statt am Haben ausrichtet, betrachtet das Dasein stets vom Standpunkt der Ewigkeit aus \u2013 im Wissen darum, dass jeglicher Besitz wieder verloren geht, es sei denn, der Besitz kann im eigenen Herzen aufbewahrt werden. Die Dankbarkeit \u00fcber das eigene Dasein f\u00fchrt zum Wunsch, anderen Menschen mit N\u00e4chstenliebe, mit Mitgef\u00fchl, Freundschaft, Sympathie und ohne Vorurteile oder Egoismus zu begegnen. Je mehr man sich durch die Dankbarkeit verwandeln l\u00e4sst, desto st\u00e4rker w\u00e4chst der Impuls, g\u00fctig und gro\u00dfherzig zu sein. Man erlebt sich als jemanden, der vom Leben reichlich beschenkt wird, weshalb man auch andere beschenken m\u00f6chte.","title":"Vom Neid zur Dankbarkeit"},{"location":"Personal_Development/Innere_MItte/#vom-jahzorn-zur-sanftmut","text":"\u00dcberma\u00df Mangel Scheintugend Tugend J\u00e4hzorn und Grausamkeit J\u00e4hzorn -> aggressiven Gef\u00fchlsausbruch, der pl\u00f6tzlich und unvermittelt (\u00bbj\u00e4h\u00ab) aus kleinstem Anlass gegen\u00fcber Personen oder Dingen auftritt.

Hass und Rachsucht sind oft der traurige Endpunkt einer langen Entwicklung. J\u00e4hzornigen Reaktionen geht praktisch immer ein leiser, unterdr\u00fcckter \u00c4rger voraus. Diese erste leise \u00c4rgerreaktion sollte man als Signal daf\u00fcr wahrnehmen und sch\u00e4tzen lernen, dass man sich in seinem Respekt herabgesetzt, in seinen Grenzen verletzt f\u00fchlt und eine bestimmte \u00c4u\u00dferung oder Handlung als ungerecht erlebt.

Tats\u00e4chlich stellt der \u00c4rger oft eine gesunde Reaktion auf \u00dcbergriffe und Verletzungen dar, weitaus angemessener als ein niedergeschlagener und \u00e4ngstlicher R\u00fcckzug.

Mit der Selbstbeobachtung in Situationen, in denen man sich \u00e4rgert, sollte eine Art Selbstgespr\u00e4ch einhergehen, indem man sich Fragen wie die folgenden stellt: Was macht mich am meisten w\u00fctend? Wieso bin ich gerade auf diese Person zornig? Was verletzt mich so sehr? G\u00e4be es eine M\u00f6glichkeit, meine negativen Gef\u00fchle angemessen auszudr\u00fccken?

Dazu geh\u00f6rt auch, mit anderen zu teilen und sich auf diese Weise gegenseitig Sicherheiten zu gew\u00e4hren. Ein freigebiger Mensch ist sich bewusst, dass sich das Rad des Schicksals best\u00e4ndig dreht. Wer im Moment oben ist und vieles besitzt, kann bald auch wieder alles verlieren und auf Zuwendungen angewiesen sein. Ein freigebiger Mensch sieht sein Hab und Gut nur als geliehen an. Er ist dankbar daf\u00fcr, dass er es zeitweilig nutzen darf. Sogar wenn er nur wenig besitzt, denkt er immer noch daran, was er anderen geben kann.

For example, if you enjoy performing an activity that requires some level of skill, you may find yourself doing it a lot and getting better at it. And as you get better at it, you may derive even more enjoyment from it. And when you enjoy it more, you do it even more and get even better at it, and so on. So in this case, skillfulness and enjoyment form a virtuous cycle in which one strengthens the other---hence you end up benefiting from both at once, at no extra cost. Joy and meditation are another pair of really nice things that form a virtuous cycle with each other. Meditation is training of the mind. Joy becomes highly accessible in a trained mind. With training, the mind learns to access inner joy with increasing ease and frequency. At the same time, the joyful mind is at peace, a peaceful mind is easily focused, and a focused mind becomes more trainable, thereby making meditation practice even more effective. Thus a virtuous and joyful cycle forms. Once you put it into motion, the meditation practice that perhaps you thought you'd never have can be sustained, and joy becomes a dominant factor in daily life. Habit A habit is a loop that consists of three parts: a cue, a routine, and a reward. ^7^ The cue is something that activates the habit---it leads to the routine. The routine is the behavior itself---it leads to the reward. The reward is the perceived benefit that comes from doing the behavior, and it reinforces the habit so that the next occurrence of the same cue is more likely to automatically activate the routine. Thus a loop forms. INFORMAL PRACTICE: CREATING A HABIT OF TAKING MINDFUL BREATHS Choose a cue, something that, when it occurs, activates the habit of taking a mindful breath. The cue I most highly recommend is any situation when you have to wait. Whenever the cue occurs, take one slow, deep breath and bring some amount of attention to that breath. For safety reasons (for example, if you're walking or driving), you may need to maintain an appropriate amount of attention to your surroundings as you pay some attention to your breath. If taking that mindful breath makes you feel any better, simply notice that. It will be the reward that reinforces the habit. Meditation is not about not thinking One of the biggest misconceptions about meditation is that it involves \"emptying your mind of all thoughts.\" This one misconception is more responsible for turning people away from meditation than any other that I know of. Meditation is about allowing the mind to settle on its own terms, in its own time, which includes allowing thoughts to arise as and when they want to. It is true that over time, with practice, as the mind becomes more deeply settled, the stream of thoughts slows down and eventually goes from being like a raging waterfall to being like a fast-flowing river, then more like a slow-flowing stream, and finally, the mind is like a placid lake. Over time (in my own case, after many, many hours of meditation practice), the mind learns to quiet down on demand, but that does not come from suppressing the process of thinking---instead, it comes from learning to give the mind the space and time to settle on its own terms. Meditation is not what you think, or not think. A skillful meditator periodically does three things: periodically he arouses mental energy, periodically he calms the mind, and periodically he watches the mind with equanimity. Simply put, skillfully managing energy in meditation boils down to balancing three mental factors: mental relaxation, mental energy, and equanimous watching. Easing into joy Resting the mind to put it into a state of ease. Being joyful at rest, no ego stroking or sensual pleasure required. Cultivating this form of inner joy begins to free us from overreliance on sense and ego stimulation for pleasure. This means joy becomes increasingly available anyplace, anytime. Whenever there is any experience of joy,\\ just notice it. That is all. FORMAL PRACTICE: NOTICING JOY IN ONE BREATH Do the One Mindful Breath exercise from Chapter 2, which is simply to take one deep breath mindfully. If any hint of joy arises anytime during the exercise, simply notice it, that is all. If no hint of joy arises, no problem either; we simply notice the absence of joy. Inclining the mind toward joy Next, we learn to notice joy and give it our full attention. We learn where to look in order to see and appreciate joy that is already available to us, in moments that we hadn't noticed before. The more the mind becomes familiar with joy, the more it perceives joy, inclines toward joy, and effortlessly creates the conditions conducive to joy. FORMAL PRACTICE: INVITING AND ATTENDING TO JOY Sit in any posture that allows you to be alert and relaxed at the same time, whatever that means to you. You may keep your eyes open or closed. Let us take three breaths. In the first breath, bring gentle but intense attention to the process of breathing. In the second breath, calm the body. In the third breath, bring up joy. If necessary, bring up a smile or a half smile, whatever the words half smile mean to you. If any joy arises, bring full attention to it. If you like, repeat this three-breaths practice a few more times. Uplifting the mind Here, we learn to uplift the mind with wholesome joy, especially joy arising from goodness, generosity, loving-kindness, and compassion. The wholesomeness of such joy benefits mental health the same way wholesome food benefits physical health. INFORMAL PRACTICE: ATTENDING TO THE JOY OF PLEASANT DAILY EXPERIENCES Whenever you engage in an activity that involves a pleasant experience, take at least one moment to attend fully to the joy that pleasantness invokes. Some examples: At each meal, attend fully to the enjoyment of at least the first bite. When seeing a loved one, especially a beloved child, take one moment to appreciate that he or she is there, and attend fully to that joy. When holding hands with a loved one, take one moment to attend fully to the joy of that contact. When taking a shower, attend fully to at least one moment of the enjoyment of the body's contact with water. When relieving yourself in the toilet, attend fully to at least one moment of the pleasure of relief. When out on a nice day, take one moment to attend fully to the enjoyment of the weather. When walking, take one moment to attend fully to the joy of being able to walk. In general, when seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, or touching something pleasant, bring full attention to the joy for at least one moment, and when interacting with a beloved person, bring full attention to the joy of being with that person for at least one moment. INFORMAL PRACTICE: AWARENESS OF MORTALITY At least once a day, either in the morning shortly after waking up or in the evening shortly before sleep, or anytime in the day, remind yourself of these two things: \u2022Someday, I will die. I will die. Every moment I have is precious. \u2022Someday, every single person I love dearly will die. They will all die. Every moment I have with them is precious. INFORMAL PRACTICE: NOTICING THE ABSENCE OF PAIN Periodically, perhaps once a day, perhaps more frequently, bring awareness to the body to see if there is any experience of pain. Do you have a headache, a toothache, neck pain, back pain, or a stomachache? If any of those parts of the body is not in pain, you may remind yourself, \"I do not have a headache / toothache / neck pain, etc., right now.\" If any joy arises due to that thought, bring attention to that joy. Periodically, perhaps once a day, perhaps more frequently, bring awareness to the mind to see if there is any experience of mental or emotional pain. Are you experiencing the pain of grief, sorrow, hatred, anger, jealousy, envy, want, grasping, fear, or desperation? If you are not experiencing any of those sources of pain right now, you may remind yourself, \"I am not afflicted by the pain of grief / sorrow / hatred, etc., right now.\" If any joy arises due to that thought, bring attention to that joy. FORMAL PRACTICE: JUST NOTE GONE Sit in any posture that allows you to be alert and relaxed at the same time, whatever that means to you. You may keep your eyes open or closed. Sit in meditation for as many minutes as you like. Apply intense attention to the end of every out breath, clearly seeing the moment it ends. At the end of an out breath, if you like, you may silently note to yourself, \"Gone.\" If any thought or sensation arises, see if you can watch it until it fades away. If it ceases at any time, even if for one moment, note its cessation. If you like, you may silently note to yourself, \"Gone.\" You may end this meditation at any time. At the moment the meditation ends, take note of its ending. If you like, you may silently note to yourself, \"Gone.\" INFORMAL PRACTICE: WISHING FOR RANDOM PEOPLE TO BE HAPPY During working hours or school hours, randomly identify two people who walk past you or who are standing or sitting around you. Secretly wish for them to be happy. Just think to yourself, \"I wish for this person to be happy, and I wish for that person to be happy.\" That is the entire practice. Don't do anything; don't say anything; just think. This is entirely a thinking exercise. If you prefer, you can do this at any time of the day for any amount of time. You can also do it at any other place. If there is nobody present, you can bring someone to mind for the purpose of this exercise. If you like, you may pretend you are firing a \"happiness ray gun\" at them and make \"pew, pew\" sound effects in your head. Batteries not required. FORMAL PRACTICE: ATTENDING TO THE JOY OF LOVING-KINDNESS Sit in any posture that allows you to be alert and relaxed at the same time, whatever that means to you. You may keep your eyes open or closed. Repeat this cycle once per minute: Bring to mind someone for whom you can very easily feel loving-kindness. Wish for him or her to be happy. The joy of loving-kindness may arise, and if that happens, bring full attention to the joy until it fades away. For the rest of the minute, just rest the mind. When the next minute begins, start the cycle again, for a total of three minutes.","title":"Joy on demand"},{"location":"Personal_Development/Joy_on_demand/#habit","text":"A habit is a loop that consists of three parts: a cue, a routine, and a reward. ^7^ The cue is something that activates the habit---it leads to the routine.

Based on thousands of years of practice, mindfulness techniques enable people to manage their attention, improve their awareness, and sharpen their focus and clarity. A mind in balance, which sees reality clearly and values ethics. Life is about results. Results come from our actions. Our actions come from the choices we make. Our choices come from the thoughts we think. We are living in an \"attention economy\" where the ability to man- age our attention and the quality of our attention is key to our success. But in the digital age, where our ability to pay attention at will is under siege, we have a problem. But from a neurological perspective, we're not capable of focusing attention on two things at the same time. When we think we are multitasking, what we are doing in reality is shift-tasking : shifting attention rapidly between two or more things. Mindfulness is about you. It's about overcoming the multitasking trap, and entering the attention economy being one second ahead of your wandering mind and external distractions. It's about generating greater mental effectiveness so that you can reach your full potential, both on a professional and a personal level. Effectiveness in this context is the ability to achieve your goals, objectives, and wishes in life. The central characteristics of mindfulness are sharp focus and open awareness. Sharp focus is the ability to concentrate single-pointedly on any object of choice for a long as you want with minimal effort. Training sharp focus provides the benefit of being fully present with other people or tasks. Open awareness is the ability to see clearly what is happening in your mind and make wise choices about where to focus your attention. Through training open awareness, you gain clarity. The clutter from the outer world and from your own mind is reduced. As you become more insightful, even the most difficult problems appear less complex and become easier to handle. Optimal effectiveness is achieved when people are simultaneously sharply focused and openly aware. Rule #1: Focus on What You Choose Staying focused on the object of your choice is the first rule of mental effectiveness. A focused mind does not multitask: instead, it's fully present on the person or task at hand. Rule #2: Choose Your Distractions Mindfully Rule #2 ensures you work in a focused way while remaining open to your surroundings and recognizing when you should change focus. Rule #2 invites us to make a subtle evaluation of every distraction. Should I deal with this distraction now or let it go? This doesn't mean you keep working on the task and shift your atten- tion back and forth between your boss and your task. That would be multitasking, and we already know that doesn't work. Instead, Rule #2 requires consciously choosing to let go of the task you were working on and focusing your full attention on your boss. Rule #1 becomes re- engaged at this point. As the first quadrant shows, when you are focused but on autopilot, your state of mind can be described as being in \"flow.\" Some people prefer to be in this state, especially when they're tackling routine tasks or physical work. Flow is characterized by some degree of absorption and therefore lacking awareness of external distractions. This can pose a problem even during routine work, because you may neglect sensory signals of important events around you or physiological signals indicating you need rest, movement, or food. We need awareness to pick up on relevant distractions---like our boss coming into our office In the second quadrant---defined as \"mindful\"---we have the greatest mental bandwidth to complete tasks and the highest quality of interactions with our environment and other people. Representing the junction of the two rules of mental effectiveness, the second quad- rant equates to being present with ourselves and what we're doing. It helps us when we encounter difficult situations and is crucial when we want to optimize our performance at work. It's a state of mind that is one second ahead of external and mental distractions. It's the best response to the digital age and a way of improving your performance in an attention economy. In the third quadrant, you're neither focused nor aware. Some people see this quadrant as the most relaxing. Taking a closer look, though, you may find that is not the case. Next time you find yourself day- dreaming on distracted autopilot, check in with your experience: are you truly relaxed? With a bit of training you will see that a focused mind is much more relaxed than a distracted mind. In the fourth quadrant, you're aware but easily distracted. There can be benefits to loosening focus and allowing random thoughts to bubble up. Some people find that they come up with more creative ideas in this quadrant. But if your mind is too distracted, you'll have difficulty retaining any good ideas. Good ideas only become innovative solutions when you have the focus to retain and execute them. Techniques Emails Avoid email addition: Disable email notifications Don't do emails first thing in the morning ( use energy for something for useful ) Allocate only certain, fixed times during the day to fully focus on e-mail. Before sending: Should this e-mail be sent at all? And should all these people be copied? E-mail is widely overused. Make sure you're not just adding to the chatter. Make sure your e-mail really needs to be sent. It's okay to delete an e-mail if it really isn't that important. Does the e-mail contain the information needed for it to be understood correctly? We've all sent or received a message without an attachment or other key detail. Oversights like these can cause multiple messages to go back and forth, all with similar ques- tions. Make sure you aren't wasting valuable time---yours or any- one else's. How will the recipient perceive this e-mail? Put yourself in the recipient's shoes. How can you phrase this note to best avoid negative speculation in the recipient's mind? Taking just one second to think about how your e-mail will be perceived can be the difference between clear communication and an unfortunate misunderstanding. One thing is certain: saying \"thanks\" and \"sorry\" are always good ideas. Avoid Emotional E-mailing Wait one day before replying. When you come across an e-mail that generates negative reactions, stop. Do not give in to the impulse to answer immediately. Think about alternative communications channels. Meetings Before Preparing: Before you introduce an agenda, simply invite meeting participants to take a brief mental break, to relax, settle their mind, and become present in the room. Sitting in a room silently for a few moments can create a strong feeling of togetherness and unity. During Be present: In meetings, presence forms the foundation for effectiveness. When we're present with other people, we get the most out of our time together. Therefore, the fundamental rule for a mindful meeting is: be completely present with those you are together with for as long as you are together. Every meeting you're in, you have the opportunity to make the people you're with the anchor of your attention. To do so, focus your attention on the person who is speaking. After Fitting in some time at the end of a meeting to practice mindfulness can also be of benefit in terms of softening a hard stop. Taking just a few minutes can help further clear the mind and increase relaxation, focus, and clarity for upcoming activities. In fact, some companies have begun letting meetings finish a few minutes early, giving participants the opportunity to settle and clear their minds before their next activity. Also, if the meeting finishes at an appropriate time, there's less of a rush. This means you have the opportunity to look coworkers in the eye and thank them for their time and attention. When a meeting is concluded with gratitude and appreciation, people are more willing to meet again and a positive pat- tern for meetings develops. Goals When you have clear goals, it's far easier to stay focused and aware. Similarly, when you're focused and aware, it's easier to keep your actions aligned with your goals. When it comes to maintaining clear goals, it's important to manage both our conscious mind and our subconscious processes. Our sub- conscious is primarily driven by two simple motivations: grasping for things we like and avoiding things we don't like. While our subconscious often craves short-term gratification, our conscious goals more often include delayed gratification. The more mindful you are, the more bandwidth of conscious attention you have. Mindfulness increases the number of conscious bits you can process. At the same time, it gives you a better awareness of what's happening in your subconscious mind. Mindfulness allows you to better align your conscious goals with your subconscious processes, keeping your goals center stage and enhancing your chances of success. Mindful Goal Orientation When you find yourself behaving counter to your goals, take a mindful pause (---focus on your breath as you calm down, gaining focus and clarity. This establishes your awareness. Ask yourself the question \"What stories, beliefs, or grasping or avoidance is keeping me from doing the thing that moves me closer to my goal?\" Whatever you find, face it and dismantle it by being present with it. Adjust your behavior and move on. Mindful Goal Setting Clearly defined and specific goals are easier for your subconscious to understand. Positively framing your goals also makes it easier for your subconscious to process them. By default, the subconscious moves toward the desirable and away from the unpleasant. Learning to hold our goals lightly, and let go of them if they won't bring us long-term happiness, is an important skill. Priorities Action Addiction Addiction to action is one of the biggest threats to mental effectiveness and productivity. The root cause of action addition is an untrained mind. A well-trained mind is the only way to overcome it. The tasks are in front of us, and we want to be useful and productive. The problem is, when we don't step back to ensure we're spending time on tasks aligned with our main goals, we end up wasting a lot of time on immediate--- though often inessential---tasks. Focus your effort on the 20% that produce 80% of your output. Choice points -- when priorities conflict Conflicting priorities are the most common causes of action addiction. When two or more priorities conflict, you reach a choice point: a point at which you need to decide how to best manage multiple priorities or competing urgencies. We often react to choice points by jumping into action. There it is again, that action addiction. But, as you now know, not all action is aligned with our goals. When priorities conflict, take a breath before you jump into action. Endure the discomfort of conflicting priorities. Speed Up by Slowing Down By taking a brief pause, you're able to maintain your focus and awareness. This allows you to respond to situations with the most appropriate action---to concentrate on your priorities and goals---rather than simply acting on autopilot. Planning Real planning requires slowing down, so that you can speed up. It's an investment in time up front that has significant payback down the road. Too often, instead of moving forward through intentional action, we end up stuck in place: working, acting, trying, but not making any real progress. The morning is the most important choice point of the day. As it sets the tone for the rest of the day, it's critical to begin the morning with a period of clear planning. Clear Planning on a Daily Basis When you get to work, make a habit of reserving the first ten minutes to do the following: Do one to two minutes of ABCD mindfulness training to enhance your focus and subdue the impulse of action addiction. Make a short list of the highest priority activities of the day---or review a list you made at the end of the previous day. Plan your calendar for the day according to the highest priorities. Now, get to work. Review your plan once or twice during the day to track your progress. Weekly and monthly planning sessions can help you keep the big picture in mind and manage your calendar accordingly. Allocate most of your time to completing activities that deliver the greatest outcomes for the least amount of effort. Leave time for the urgent matters that will inevitably crop up. How much time you set aside for urgent matters depends on the nature of your work. Whatever you decide, saving a realistic margin of unscheduled time can help you avoid being put under unnecessary pressure. Consider how much time you need to recharge your mental batteries every day---whether through small breaks, a short walk, or your ten minutes of mindfulness training. Finally, make sure to reserve time for unavoidable \"transition\" activities, such as follow-up communication after meetings and travel. Communication The foundation of mindful communication is, as in many other aspects of life, being fully present in your interactions with other people. Only when we're fully present do we get the most out of our time together. And only when we're fully present can we be sure to under- stand what's actually being communicated. Empathy---being in tune with the feelings of others---plays a major role in effective communication. If you have a sense of how the person with whom you're trying to communicate feels, it's easier to get on their wavelength. From a neurological perspective, two fundamental tendencies in the human mind create barriers to effective communication. First, there's the reality of the mind's natural tendency to wander. The second tendency is our mind's orientation to see things as we expect to see them, commonly known as habitual perception. Habitual perception or cognitive rigidity as it's also known---is the mind's natural desire to place reality into simple, pre-existing categories. This causes us to believe the mind's own limited projections about other people, ourselves, and all the things we encounter. Thus we are being cognitively rigid when we limit our perceptions. Both our wandering minds and this rigidity severely hinder our ability to communicate. Listen with Mindfulness Simply put, listening with mindfulness involves giving your full attention to whoever is speaking. There are four guidelines for listening with this type of focus. Speaking with Mindfulness Creativity Take more intentional pauses throughout these meetings to give people the opportunity to relax and release any of the attachment they had to one idea or another. Formulate the Problem (and write it down) Let go of the problem Allow time Activate You've now identified a problem, let it go, and given your subconscious time to work. The final task is to help your subconscious communicate with your conscious. Change We are habitual beings. In fact, scientists estimate that 95 percent of our behaviors are based on habit. In other words, only 5 percent of what we do is based on conscious choice. Not only are we habitual, but we're also neurologically programmed to prefer that things stay the same. Familiarity provides us with a greater sense of psychological safety. Learning to embrace the reality of constant change is a powerful thing. When we experience a great day at work---or a challenging day---without expecting that the next day will be the same, we become much more resilient in the face of change. Building greater acceptance of the reality of constant change is a foundation for more balance, less stress, better health, and ultimately more peace of mind. Hardwired to value certainty, our natural response is to resist uncertainty in our environment. In fact, it would be strange if we didn't experience some resistance to change. Since we're habitual beings, doing anything differently takes effort. Even if the change is something we want, it requires effort to overcome both our neurological impulse to keep things the same as well as our ingrained habitual patterns. When we try to resist resistance, we only generate more of it. We create an inner struggle that often leads to anger, frustration, stress, and anxiety. Resisting resistance doesn't help us move forward; instead, it negatively impacts both our health and well-being. The key to managing resistance and thereby better managing change is to face it and embrace it. Once you're able to observe your resistance, see whether there's anything you can learn from it. Are you resisting simply because of your natural preference for familiarity? Or are you resisting because something legitimately doesn't make sense? Seeking to understand the underlying driver of your resistance can be insightful. Steps for Mindful Change Management Awareness of the change The first step is simply to recognize that things are changing. Gain as much information as possible regarding the change and what it might entail. Ideally, this process is done with a mind that accepts the reality of constant change, enabling curiosity, rather than fear, to be the driver behind the investigative process. Awareness of your own resistance The second step is to be aware of any resistance to the change. If you think you don't have any resistance, think again. It's natural for us to resist change; there's nothing wrong with resistance. Resistance can be very instructive and can help us gain insight into how to better manage the change. When you become aware of any resistance, don't try to run from it or resist it. Observation of your resistance The third step is to observe the resistance. Seek to understand where it comes from and what might be underlying it. See if there's anything you can learn from it that might inform or enhance the change management process. Mindfully choose your response With a solid understanding of the change and your resistance to it, you can choose a response. This may mean you choose to fully embrace the change and let go of any resistance. It may also mean you choose to try to skillfully influence the change process by mindfully presenting other alternatives. It may mean you choose not to accept the change because you realize it's not in your best interest. Regardless of your choice, make the decision with a calm, clear mind. Act The final step is to take action in accordance with your choices. This is where you move forward. Although this step will help you better manage the change process, that doesn't mean it will be easy! It's helpful to acknowledge that it will be difficult to change habitual patterns. You'll likely have ongoing spikes of resistance and setbacks in the process. During this step, it's important to both identify and accept the support you need to manage the change. This could be attending training, being coached, or practicing mindfulness. Mental energy When it comes to conserving mental energy, mindfulness can help in four key ways: being present, maintaining balance, making choices, and leveraging cycles. Being Present Being present in the here and now is a simple and easy way to conserve mental resources. When we allow our mind to wander aimlessly, it's using up valuable energy that could be better used in other pursuits. Maintaining Balance Awareness of negative or positive thought spirals allows us to leverage balance. Being aware of the mind's tendency to succumb to attraction or aversion---to run toward things we want or away from things we don't want---is powerful. Making Choices Follow the first rule of mental effectiveness and choose a task and stick with it. Notice the impact that not jumping back and forth between tasks can have on your energy. Leveraging Cycles Our mental energy naturally ebbs and flows throughout the day, in cycles that have a lot to do with our sleep, nutrition, and level of physical activity. We simply are not always at peak mental performance. For most people, energy levels are higher first thing in the morning, after a good night's rest. Those energy levels tend to decrease during the day, with a low point after lunch, before increasing again later in the afternoon. Being mindful of our how our energy levels fluctuate enables us to be strategic about what we do and when. Enhancing sleep TURN off All Screens 60 Minutes before Sleep Perceptual Activities 60 Minutes before Sleep Conceptual activities like intense conversations, replying to e-mails, working, or reading can arouse your attention and suppress your natural sleepiness. Instead of doing the dishes and other practical activities just after dinner, leave that for the last hour before sleep, instead of screen activities. Waking Mindfully As you wake, be determined not to start thinking. Just be. Notice your body. Notice your mind. But do not engage in the thoughts trying to arise. Sit up, at the edge of your bed, and do two minutes of mindfulness training. Focus on your breath and let go of any thoughts. Eating and Energy To get the most out of mindful eating, there are three basic guidelines: Let Your Stomach Do the Eating A simple mindful tip for eating is to let your stomach do the eating. There's no need to finish everything in front of you right this second. Avoid the Blood Sugar Rollercoaster Many of us, seeking a quick antidote to feeling sleepy, ride the blood sugar rollercoaster during the afternoon hours. An hour or two after lunch, we hit the afternoon slump---a fatigue our brains mis- takes for a lack of blood glucose. A natural and automatic reaction is to grab a snack, a cup of coffee, or an energy drink to quickly raise our energy levels. But a snack---and a sugary one in particular---can raise blood sugar levels too high, leading to mood swings, brain fog, and stress. After a short while, blood sugar levels plummet. A sense of panic results due to the stress, cortisol, and adrenaline released when fatigue and brain fog set in. Then we're right back where we started, at the bottom of the roller coaster, with our brains craving another fix of fast energy. The Mindful Minute Over time, allowing you a mindful minute before immediately snacking can mitigate the general craving that comes with natural tiredness. Next time you feel desire for food, pause. Allow yourself to mindfully observe the experience of desire. Allow the experience to be present, without engaging and giving in to it. This is not meant to impart strict discipline and impulse control, merely a moment of mindfulness before you eat. Ask yourself, what does it feel like? Where do you experience the feeling, in your stomach or elsewhere? Is the experience changing or does it stay the same? If after the minute, you're feeling the same desire, you may actually be hungry. In that case, eat. If there's little or no desire left, you weren't actually hungry. Your brain tried to trick you. But you were smarter, and dismantled the desire by simply allowing it to rise without engaging in it. When you're mindful of your food, awareness tells you when you have had enough. You tend to eat less. You also tend to enjoy food more, because you actually pay attention to it. Activity and energy When you have positive physical experiences, your mind smiles. In this way, caring for the body is just as impactful as caring for the mind. Getting good and sufficient sleep, eating properly, and being physically active are all foundations for both performance and well- being. Maintaining a clear focus while undertaking physical activity trans- forms a workout into a semi-mindfulness session and will improve your experience. Relaxation---The Absence of Unnecessary Effort A relaxed body---one absent of unnecessary tension---has greater endurance and generally feels more pleasant. As you train, occasionally Activity and Energy scan your body for signs of unnecessary effort or tension. Then relax. The more relaxed you are, the more you can do and the more you'll enjoy it. While relaxation is also important for the mind to avoid thinking and distraction, the mind needs an object of focus. You need to have an anchor---and that anchor is usually your breath. While breathing is a great anchor while you're sitting still, it's equally powerful during physical activity. But breath alone may not be enough. Instead, it can be more effective to synchronize your breath with the natural rhythm of your physical activity. When you run or walk, synchronize your steps with your breath. Take a certain number of steps for each inhalation and each exhalation. This way, you can easily maintain a focused and steady rhythm for long periods. It's often easier than just focusing on your breathing. Focus and rhythm can be a big help, especially if you feel poorly or experience pain. Most unpleasantness comes from our thoughts. Thoughts come from physical sensations or other distractions. Your focus creates your reality. Focus on unpleasantness, and your reality will be unpleasant. Instead, focus on your breathing and rhythm---and experience one moment at a time. As distractions appear, don't try to suppress them. Simply take one moment after the other: one step after the other. Inhale and exhale. Don't think about how much time you have left. Stay in the moment. With relaxed focus, any unpleasantness or pain will diminish. Performance breaks A mindful performance break is basically a very brief mindfulness training session. And by brief, I mean about 45 seconds. To take mind- ful performance breaks, try this, once every hour during work. Let go of your activities. You don't need to go anywhere special. Close your eyes or keep them open, whichever you prefer. Direct your full attention to your breath. For three breath cycles do the following: Breathe in while noticing your breath breathe out while relaxing your shoulders, neck, and arms. Breathe in while focusing fully on your inhale; breathe out while focusing on the exhale. Breathe in while enhancing the clarity of your attention; breathe out while maintaining clarity. Let go of the exercise. Return to your work with renewed relaxation, focus, and clarity. Emotional balance Emotions are a natural part of being human. Managed skillfully, they're a powerful source of joy and energy. Unsuccessfully managed, however, they can get in the way, becoming a source of frustration, conflict, and regret. In reality, having emotional balance equates to not getting caught up in the natural ups and downs of our emotions. Emotional balance is a state of being aware of our emotions enough to manage them in a way that is gentle, honest, and wise. Mirroring others' emotions is normal; it's your mirror neurons at play. More about mirror neurons is presented in the mental strategy of Joy. But in short, when we face someone joyful, mirror neurons in our brains make us experience a similar joy. The same goes for anger, grief, and almost all other emotions. Most of us deal with our emotions by either suppressing them or acting them out. The thing about suppressing emotions is that they have to go somewhere. Like pressing down on a balloon, pushing your emotions down only means they will pop up again somewhere else. Additionally, suppressing emotions requires an enormous amount of mental energy---energy that's diverted from our own focus and clarity. Acting out our emotions, whether aggressively or passive aggressively, might feel good in the moment. But if acting out is effective at all, it's only in that moment. In the long run, acting out our emotions usually leads to disappointment, regret, or shame. In mindfulness training, we work to develop the mental capacity, the patience, and the courage to endure discomfort. At the same time, we learn to observe our emotions with some neutrality. We put some kind of distance between our emotions and ourselves. Instead of running on autopilot, being absorbed with emotion and caught in its grip, we take a moment to pause. We stay one second ahead of automatic reactions, giving ourselves the time, space, and freedom to make conscious, deliberate choices. Emotional Awareness Being aware of the emotion---may sound obvious, but it's not always as easy as it sounds. In the midst of our everyday busyness, the mind is already occupied with myriad distractions and mountains of information. Mindful Embrace Simply notice that the emotion is there and hold it without suppressing or acting on it. Open awareness training. Being able to see the emotion as an experience, and not letting it overcome you, diminishes its power. Instead of constantly fighting against the emotion, you're able to be with it. When it comes to mindful embrace, your breath can be helpful. While observing the emotion, pay attention to your breath; allow its gentle rhythm to calm you. Patience and Balance Patience is about having the courage to face the discomfort of the emotion. Patience will help you endure and contain the emotion, rather than flee from it. Whereas patience can help you ride out the emotion, balance can keep you neutral. Balance can help you avoid any automatic aversion or attraction you may have toward it. With the ability to embrace the emotion with patience and balance, you can now maintain the focus Emotional Balance and clarity necessary to determine the best, most productive response to it. Appropriate Response Making a decision---choosing the most appropriate response to the situation---based on your awareness of the emotion, your embracing of it, and your patience and balance. Work-life balance Imbalance is only a problem if people perceive it that way or if work negatively impacts other areas of life. Focus --- Training in mindfulness helps you feel less overwhelmed by daily tasks and challenges. It helps provide the clarity of mind to accept what you can't change, and make mindful choices about where to place your limited attention---in a way that best serves you and others. Further, it helps you be present with the imbalance, allowing you to sit with the discomfort, observe it, and not let it overwhelm your mind. Awareness ---Training in mindfulness helps you maintain awareness of when you're not in balance. It helps keep you from falling into habitual patterns that are unhealthy, both for yourself and others around you. It also helps you distinguish between what you can and can't control. Mindfulness helps you maintain balance within yourself by accepting life's imbalances. It allows you to let go of things outside of your control, saving all that mental energy to manage things within your control and thereby reducing stress and worry. Mental strategies Think of these strategies as another layer you can add on top of the techniques to quickly and easily improve your performance at work. They don't replace the techniques---and they certainly don't replace the foundational training methods---but they do mitigate the most persistent thoughts and habits that can prevent you from being your best self moment to moment. Presence Presence is foundational for mindfulness. By definition, being present means we're paying attention to the people, objects, and ideas around us. This level of attention is at the very core of managing focus and awareness---the central characteristics of mindfulness---and maintaining mental effectiveness. When we're present for others, we embody all three definitions of present : we're here and in this moment as a gift for other people. Instead of hopping on the neural carousel, be fully present when you're with other people. Be fully present with your tasks. Be fully present with challenges when they occur. Being present in the moment doesn't require a change in what you do . It requires a change in how you pay attention to what you do. It's a conscious decision to be present in the moment. Patience \"A moment of patience in a moment of anger saves you a thousand moments of regret.\" Patience involves choosing to stay calm in the face of challenging situations, even when our fight or flight reflex might already be triggered. It's the ability to endure unpleasantness, to confront the situation directly and handle it sensibly, rather than on impulse. Patience is more concerned with larger goals than temporary, quick-fix solutions. Patience is the direct path to living a more effective life that's focused on the roots of problems instead of the symptoms. Kindness What do we need from other people to be happy? Often the answer is simple: things like presence, attention, respect, understanding, and acceptance. What do other people need from us to be happy? The exact same things. In this way, we're all experts in making each other happy. Beginners mind In my experience, looking anew is foundational for business success. Without the ability to do so, we default to yesterday's perception of the market and the competition. We become complacent---and might just wake up to find ourselves behind the bus. A few natural traits stand between each of us and a beginner's mind: namely, habitual perception and cognitive rigidity. The automatic association between what's actually in front of you and what you've seen in the past---the neurological process called habitual perception---can be problematic. It means you often don't actually see what's right there in front of you. In fact, what you do see has much less to do with actual reality, and much more to do with the reality your mind creates based on your history and habits. In other words, you have programmed yourself to see reality in a certain way. Cognitive rigidity---the inflexibility created by automatically recalling our habitual perceptions---is not conducive to creativity. It doesn't help us innovate. Or help us to see new solutions to old challenges, let alone new solutions to new challenges. The ability to face reality as it is---or at least not be stuck in old ways of seeing things---is the essence of a beginner's mind. Without a beginner's mind, we lock ourselves inside our own experience; we stagnate in our mind's habitual perception. With a beginner's mind, we see things with fresh eyes and an open mind. Challenge yourself to be more curious in your day-to-day activities. Be open to what is happening to you moment to moment. The less you presume to know, the more your mind will open. Acceptance Balance When you stop yourself from following an impulse---say, quitting after one serving of your favorite food or drink---serotonin balances out the dopamine release. In your daily mindfulness training, you're constantly resisting impulses to follow distracting thoughts or hold onto stress. Consciously identify the tasks at work that bring your instant gratification---say answering an e-mail or text. Now identify the tasks that bring discomfort. This may be fielding com- plaints from customers or confronting a surly coworker. Be aware of your reactions to these tasks and temper those reac- tions by purposefully limiting or delaying the gratification of the experiences you like, while more actively confronting the experiences you dislike. You train balance by being aware of your reaction to everything you experience, good, bad, and neutral. Notice the experiences you like and those you do not like, things where you experience attraction and things where you experience aversion. Just being aware of these reactions will lead to change. When you become aware of a desire, the desire will lessen as it's replaced by awareness of the desire. When you become aware of resistance, the resistance will lessen as it's replaced by awareness of it. If something is pleasant and nice, you observe it neutrally without giving it more value or holding onto it. If something is unpleasant, you observe it neutrally without wanting it to disappear. Joy Joy boosts our energy and performance; it enhances our ability to do good work and excel at business. Like all feelings, joy is something we can enable inside ourselves. Our nervous system reacts to our state of mind. What we feel mentally has a significant effect on our physical body. Quite simply, joy equates to taking better care of both body and mind. When we're happy doing something, we expand both our mental and physical resources. Letting go When you identify an issue or problem that seems to stay with you, to follow you from task to task or from work to home, mentally hold on to it. Isolate the initial thought before the related thoughts begin to multiply. Then after you isolate it and observe it, let it pass. And instead, purposefully refocus on what's happening in the moment. Use the quality of relaxation to help you let go of your thoughts. When you think, you create tension in your body. When you relax your body, you also relax your thoughts. Relax your body and allow a natural mental relaxation to follow. Then, use your focus on the experience of breathing to help you let go of thoughts and be in the moment---one breath at a time. As you begin to explore the nature of your thoughts, you will notice that some can be very difficult to let go of. Consider seeing these as opportunities to rewire your brain to let go more easily. Every time one of these difficult thoughts comes up, notice the thought is there and see if you can let it go or not. Foundational practices Mindfulness training is an investment. It takes time. And it takes effort. And while many would argue they have no time for mindfulness training because they are busy, I see it very differently. Mindfulness training is increasingly important to me, the busier I get. The more things I need to do, the more time I train. That's my way of ensuring I can stay focused, calm, and effective and not let the busyness clutter my mind. Training sharp focus Sharp focus is the ability to concentrate on thoughts and tasks of your choice, without feeling the need to indulge each and every distraction that passes through your mind. Having this sort of mental clarity can help the busiest of us thrive, even in high-pressure environments filled with distractions. The ABCD Method Mindfulness training is not passive. It's an active intervention in your brain's neural network. For every moment you maintain focus, you create new \"focus\" neural connections and abilities. Thanks to neuroplasticity, the more you train, the stronger these neural connections and pathways become---and the easier it becomes to stay focused. Anatomy: Finding the Right Posture Sit on a chair with both feet planted firmly on the floor. Find balance. Don't lean back, forward, or to either side. Sit with your back straight, but relaxed. Sitting up straight will help you to stay awake and alert. Relax your body as much as you can. Pay special attention to your neck, shoulders, and arms---the places where many of us carry tension. Take time to release any tension you may feel. If it helps, roll your neck or move your shoulders up and down a few times. Also, take a deep breath and relax as you breathe out. Place your hands on your knees or in your lap. Close your eyes. If you start to doze off, open your eyes a little. Letting a small amount of light in activates your nervous sys- tem. If you opt to keep your eyes open, look down at the floor in front of you with a soft gaze. Breathe in and out through your nose. You may find it helps to scan your body for tension, releasing it every- where you notice it, for the first few minutes of your training---or as long as it takes to feel alert but relaxed. In this way, you will gradually develop a more relaxed body. And a more relaxed body lays the groundwork for a more relaxed mind, both prerequisites for training sharp focus. Breathing: The Anchor for Attention Focus your full attention on the experience of breathing. Be aware of how your stomach expands when you breathe in and contracts when you breathe out. If focusing on your belly doesn't feel natural, try observing your breathing at the nostrils. Pay attention to the air flowing in and out of your nose. Let the observation of your breath be neutral and effortless. You don't need to breathe deeply or slowly. You don't need to manipulate or change it. You don't have to get involved in it in any way. Observe it in the same way you would waves rolling in to beach. You don't try to control the waves---you just watch. While it can be challenging, neutral observation is very important as we go further into the training. Counting for Focus Breathe in. Breathe out. When you finish breathing out, count \"one.\" A short and succinct mental count. Breathe in again, out again, and count \"two.\" Carry on in the same way until you get to ten, then count backward to one. Repeat this cycle If you have trouble counting higher than three or seven without losing focus, don't worry. The point of counting is not to see how many times you get through the cycle; rather, it's a tool to help you maintain focus. If you suddenly find yourself at, you've been counting on autopilot and are not managing your attention. Start again at one. In the same way, if you find you've stopped counting altogether, simply start again at one. If you find thoughts sneaking in between numbers, that's a sign you're not fully focused on your breath. Sharpen your focus on your breath and give it your full attention, in a relaxed manner. If counting, or any other specific tactic gets in the way, don't get upset. Instead, be grateful that you've recognized what doesn't work for you and see it as an opportunity to make your own training more effective. Distractions: Relax, Release, Return Distractions are your best friends in focus training. Distractions are the ones telling you when you are off track. What is a distraction? Basically anything that is not your breath is a distraction. And they can come from six sources: smell, taste, bodily sensations, sight, sounds, and the mind itself. Regardless of where the distraction comes from, the instructions for dealing with it are the same: Relax, Release, and Return. Relax: When you perceive you are distracted by a thought, sound, or sensation, notice whether it creates any tension any- where in your body. Try your best to release that tension. Relax. Recognize the fact that you have been distracted. It's really not the end of the world. Instead of getting frustrated or annoyed, think of that distraction as a good friend---one who gently reminds you that your attention has drifted. Treat every time you notice yourself being distracted as a moment to celebrate. After all, when you are aware that your mind has drifted, you are being mindful! Release: Release whatever distraction you may encounter, simply by redirecting your focus toward your breath. Your full focus One Second Ahead can only be in one place at a time. If you choose your breath, the distraction is gradually released. Let go of the distraction gratefully, it helped you notice the fact that you had lost track of your breathing. Return: Once you have released the distraction and regained a sense of relaxation, come back to your breathing with renewed focus and awareness. You'll likely find focus training is a continual back and forth between paying attention to your breathing and being distracted. Some days, there will be more distractions than focus. Other days, there will be more focus than distraction. Remember, the objective is not to sit without distractions. If it were, none of us would succeed. The objective is to be aware of the fact that you're distracted and to acknowledge that you have the ability to regain your focus on your breath. It's the conscious placing of our attention that's critical to training sharp focus. The Three Core Qualities of Mindfulness: Relaxation, Focus, and Clarity Overcome Tension with Relaxation When you practice mindfulness, you may find yourself caught up in this neurological \"performance mode.\" It may seem almost unnatural to sit still, especially with so many tasks that need to be done. In the spirit of performance, you may push yourself to follow training instructions with- out truly understanding their greater purpose. But wanting to be \"good at\" mindfulness so you can get it over with---and assume the benefits of a high-performing mind as soon as possible---won't get you very far. When you breathe in, scan your body to identify points where you are experiencing tension. When you breathe out, pay attention to that point and allow the tension to release. Let the tension be released with the breath. It may be necessary to repeat the exercise several times to be effective. Take as much time as needed with each tension point before moving on to the next point where you find tension. Keep in mind the following definition: \"Relaxation is the absence of unnecessary effort.\" Scan your body for any unnecessary effort and gently let it go. Scan and release tension in your body for the first minute of your training or as long as it takes to increase your ability to be alert but relaxed. In this way you will gradually develop a more relaxed body and mind. Overcome Overactivity with Focus A focused mind does not wander. A focused mind can stay focused on an object of choice. But sometimes our minds can be overactive, wandering in every possible direction or following every distraction that arises. In many instances, the natural response to an excited mind is frustration, and the result is to try to force greater attention on your breath. Although applying such force may help you Training Sharp Focus maintain focus, it will be exhausting and counterproductive to creating a calm and clear mind. The first response to an overactive and distracted mind is to relax. The alternative strategy for increasing focus is to actually let go of performance expectations. Let your breath hold your attention. Your breathing works by itself. Every in-breath is followed by an out-breath. Rest your full attention in this movement, effortlessly, as a neutral observer. Overcome Drowsiness with Clarity When you experience drowsiness, you need to arouse your attention and increase alertness. You can do this by sitting up a little straighter or taking an intentionally deep breath. You can also open your eyes, keeping them pointed downward toward the floor to minimize distractions. One Second Ahead Another strategy to increase clarity is to arouse a deep sense of curiosity in the natural experience of breathing. Experience each breath as a new experience. Be curious about the subtle detail of your breath: Where do you notice it? How does it feel? What's it doing? When you first experience any sense of drowsiness, increase your alertness. Don't let the dullness take hold. Be purposeful and intentional in your training. With time, it gets easier. You will notice the warning signs earlier and be able to stay clear before drowsiness takes hold. Ultimately, mindfulness training is not about being able to sit still and maintain focus on your breath. It's about improving your ability to focus on the most important facets of your life: your work, your coworkers, and your family. Most people notice the greatest impact in these areas after just a few weeks. Try to relax and enjoy the benefits you're experiencing---even if, in the beginning, this is just ten minutes of space, stillness, and peace in your life. From Sharp Focus to Open Awareness In training open awareness, as explored in the next chapter, you go a step further. During open awareness training, a sharpened focus helps generate insight into both the nature of the mind and how its performance can be optimized. With open awareness training, you develop a panoramic view that helps you see yourself, others, and every situation more objectively---allowing you to decide who and what gets your attention, and who and what does not. Open awareness is the ability to observe your mind. It is training in becoming familiar with the workings of the mind and how that causes us to experience challenges in life. Open awareness helps you not be a victim of circumstance---only able to react automatically to situations as they develop. Open awareness involves training for a new kind of relationship with your thoughts and the world around you. It engenders certain clarity in the mind, allowing you to stay one second ahead of your reactions, regardless of the situation. With open awareness, autopilot is no longer the default response mechanism. Instead, it catalyzes the ability to relate to the events in your mind, bringing a whole new sense of clarity and direction into your life and work. Training open awareness provides you with the opportunity to experience, with a depth of understanding, that your thoughts are the root cause of your problems. Open awareness gives sharp focus direction and intentionality. Together, sharp focus and open awareness can help you spend your time, energy, and attention mindfully, ultimately increasing your effectiveness in life and work. The essence of open awareness training is observing your thoughts, senses, emotions and tasks in a neutral way---like a mental observatory. As in focus training, start by sitting comfortably, as described under the guidance in the \"A\" for Anatomy. For a minute or two, direct your full attention toward your breathing, like in the focus training. Allow your mind to stabilize and settle. Count your breaths if it helps you let go of distractions. Check off one by one whether your mind has the three core qualities of relaxation, focus, and clarity. When you've reached some level of these qualities, you can begin to open your awareness. Let go of the attention on your breathing and open up to whatever may arise. When the first distraction attracts your attention---a sound, thought, physical sensation, or anything else---direct your full attention to it and use it as an anchor for your awareness. Observe the distraction neutrally, just as you did with your breathing. Don't think about it. Don't engage in it. Don't try to make it stay or go away. Simply observe it. If it helps, imagine observing the distractions as if they were waves on the beach. Notice when the distraction comes into focus. Notice that it's there. Notice when at some point it disappears or changes to something else. When a distraction disappears, you open up and are ready to receive the next one in the same way. If a distraction changes into something else, you follow the transformation neutrally. If at any point you find you're confused or overwhelmed by your distractions, pause, relax, release the distractions, and return your focus to your breath. After a few moments, when you've stabilized your focus, let go of your breathing and open your awareness again. At any time, you can always come back to the anchor and simply focus on your breath. Be prepared that you may need to come back to your breath again and again throughout your training to ensure you're not getting carried away by thoughts and distractions. If it's difficult to have a neutral approach to the distraction, that is, if you notice you start to engage with it, it can be helpful to give it a short mental label. For example, if a thought arises about something you need to buy, you can label it \"shopping\" and observe the experience of the thought without thinking about what it is and where you will get it. You can also use even simpler labels such as \"thought,\" \"sensation,\" and \"feeling,\" without qualifiers. While the instructions are simple, the challenge for many is observing thoughts, feelings, sensations, and emotions neutrally without engaging. In fact, many find training open awareness difficult, especially in the beginning. Use open awareness as a basis for your training for a couple of weeks as you develop your ability to be a neutral observer of your thoughts and experiences. When you feel able to respond to distractions deliberately rather than react automatically, you can move to the next level of open awareness training that includes the three insights outlined below. Insight #1: Everything Changes Rationally, we understand that even the most frustrating situation will eventually change. Even so, the mind has a tendency to hold on to difficult situations as if they will always be there. The first insight of open awareness is about developing an instinctive understanding that everything changes, that everything is transitory. Everything. The more you come to grasp, in a meaningful way, the fact that everything changes, the easier it becomes to deal with negative things, because you know they will change. You will also place a higher value on the positive things you experience, appreciating them more while they last. In your training, and in life, when observing your distractions, regardless of what they are, ask yourself the following questions: Is there anything you experience that is unchanging? Is there a thought that never goes away? Is there anything solid and static, or is it all a process? Insight #2: Happiness Is a Choice Similarly, the situations we experience don't cause frustration or anger on their own. Rather, it's the way we relate to our surroundings that creates the problems we perceive in life. Regardless of external circumstances, we are the source of our own happiness or frustration. By changing our worldview, we have the potential to free ourselves from the problems we create. \"We all have two wolves inside us. One is bad and feels anger, jealousy, envy, falsehoods, and arrogance. The other is good and feels love, empathy, honesty, generosity, and humility. The two wolves constantly fight each other.\" One of the grandchildren asks, \"But which one wins?\" \"The one you feed,\" the old man answers. Insight #3: Everything Is Potential The insight that everything is potential and that there is no solid, isolated self means we can redefine ourselves. We can break free of our own limited definitions of ourselves and others. New possibilities open up in every situation we encounter. Nothing is fixed. We have the choice to define all people and all situations based on our perspectives, however narrow or expansive they may be. When everything is potential, it offers each and every one of us an abundance of opportunities and positive outcomes. Mastering Your Life---Next Steps The minutes that you sit training your focus or awareness may be the only few minutes of the day that are really yours. Allow yourself to rest in these precious moments. It's your time. It's your mind. It's your life. How Long and How Often to Train In my experience of guiding many people from a wide range of cultures, a minimum of ten minutes a day of mindfulness training ensures good results. As you gradually develop, you can increase the duration as much as you like. The more you do it, the more you'll get out of it. Just like with physical exercise, more time spent training equates to greater outcomes. In terms of frequency, I recommend you set aside time every day to practice. Daily training is the best way to get results. When you do it every day, it will become a habit. In my experience, the morning is a good time for most people. The mind is fresh, and therefore you get more out of the training. In addition, when you spend ten minutes at the start of the day to consciously be focused and aware, it has a strong influence on the rest of the day. Self-Directed Mindfulness Program The following are the most basic guidelines for a ten week self-directed training program. Each week you: Undertake ten minutes of sharp focus or open awareness training on a daily basis; Select a mental strategy from Part II; Select one or two workplace techniques from Part I. This program begins with focus training because it's the foundation for all the other elements. Only after you've developed a substantial level of focus---typically after four to five weeks of daily training--- should you move on to awareness training. After the ten weeks, you'll have experienced both types of training and can choose the one you prefer.","title":"MIndfullness at work"},{"location":"Personal_Development/MIndfullness_at_work/#mindfulness","text":"Mindfulness means trained attention. Based on thousands of years of practice, mindfulness techniques enable people to manage their attention, improve their awareness, and sharpen their focus and clarity. A mind in balance, which sees reality clearly and values ethics. Life is about results. Results come from our actions. Our actions come from the choices we make. Our choices come from the thoughts we think. We are living in an \"attention economy\" where the ability to man- age our attention and the quality of our attention is key to our success. But in the digital age, where our ability to pay attention at will is under siege, we have a problem. But from a neurological perspective, we're not capable of focusing attention on two things at the same time. When we think we are multitasking, what we are doing in reality is shift-tasking : shifting attention rapidly between two or more things. Mindfulness is about you. It's about overcoming the multitasking trap, and entering the attention economy being one second ahead of your wandering mind and external distractions. It's about generating greater mental effectiveness so that you can reach your full potential, both on a professional and a personal level. Effectiveness in this context is the ability to achieve your goals, objectives, and wishes in life. The central characteristics of mindfulness are sharp focus and open awareness. Sharp focus is the ability to concentrate single-pointedly on any object of choice for a long as you want with minimal effort. Training sharp focus provides the benefit of being fully present with other people or tasks. Open awareness is the ability to see clearly what is happening in your mind and make wise choices about where to focus your attention. Through training open awareness, you gain clarity. The clutter from the outer world and from your own mind is reduced. As you become more insightful, even the most difficult problems appear less complex and become easier to handle. Optimal effectiveness is achieved when people are simultaneously sharply focused and openly aware.","title":"Mindfulness"},{"location":"Personal_Development/MIndfullness_at_work/#rule-1-focus-on-what-you-choose","text":"Staying focused on the object of your choice is the first rule of mental effectiveness.

Rule #2 invites us to make a subtle evaluation of every distraction. Should I deal with this distraction now or let it go? This doesn't mean you keep working on the task and shift your atten- tion back and forth between your boss and your task. That would be multitasking, and we already know that doesn't work. Instead, Rule #2 requires consciously choosing to let go of the task you were working on and focusing your full attention on your boss. Rule #1 becomes re- engaged at this point. As the first quadrant shows, when you are focused but on autopilot, your state of mind can be described as being in \"flow.\" Some people prefer to be in this state, especially when they're tackling routine tasks or physical work. Flow is characterized by some degree of absorption and therefore lacking awareness of external distractions. This can pose a problem even during routine work, because you may neglect sensory signals of important events around you or physiological signals indicating you need rest, movement, or food. We need awareness to pick up on relevant distractions---like our boss coming into our office In the second quadrant---defined as \"mindful\"---we have the greatest mental bandwidth to complete tasks and the highest quality of interactions with our environment and other people. Representing the junction of the two rules of mental effectiveness, the second quad- rant equates to being present with ourselves and what we're doing. It helps us when we encounter difficult situations and is crucial when we want to optimize our performance at work. It's a state of mind that is one second ahead of external and mental distractions. It's the best response to the digital age and a way of improving your performance in an attention economy. In the third quadrant, you're neither focused nor aware. Some people see this quadrant as the most relaxing. Taking a closer look, though, you may find that is not the case. Next time you find yourself day- dreaming on distracted autopilot, check in with your experience: are you truly relaxed? With a bit of training you will see that a focused mind is much more relaxed than a distracted mind. In the fourth quadrant, you're aware but easily distracted. There can be benefits to loosening focus and allowing random thoughts to bubble up. Some people find that they come up with more creative ideas in this quadrant. But if your mind is too distracted, you'll have difficulty retaining any good ideas. Good ideas only become innovative solutions when you have the focus to retain and execute them.","title":"Rule #2: Choose Your Distractions Mindfully"},{"location":"Personal_Development/MIndfullness_at_work/#techniques","text":"","title":"Techniques"},{"location":"Personal_Development/MIndfullness_at_work/#emails","text":"Avoid email addition: Disable email notifications Don't do emails first thing in the morning ( use energy for something for useful ) Allocate only certain, fixed times during the day to fully focus on e-mail.

Empathy---being in tune with the feelings of others---plays a major role in effective communication. If you have a sense of how the person with whom you're trying to communicate feels, it's easier to get on their wavelength. From a neurological perspective, two fundamental tendencies in the human mind create barriers to effective communication. First, there's the reality of the mind's natural tendency to wander. The second tendency is our mind's orientation to see things as we expect to see them, commonly known as habitual perception. Habitual perception or cognitive rigidity as it's also known---is the mind's natural desire to place reality into simple, pre-existing categories. This causes us to believe the mind's own limited projections about other people, ourselves, and all the things we encounter. Thus we are being cognitively rigid when we limit our perceptions.

In fact, scientists estimate that 95 percent of our behaviors are based on habit. In other words, only 5 percent of what we do is based on conscious choice. Not only are we habitual, but we're also neurologically programmed to prefer that things stay the same. Familiarity provides us with a greater sense of psychological safety. Learning to embrace the reality of constant change is a powerful thing. When we experience a great day at work---or a challenging day---without expecting that the next day will be the same, we become much more resilient in the face of change. Building greater acceptance of the reality of constant change is a foundation for more balance, less stress, better health, and ultimately more peace of mind. Hardwired to value certainty, our natural response is to resist uncertainty in our environment. In fact, it would be strange if we didn't experience some resistance to change. Since we're habitual beings, doing anything differently takes effort. Even if the change is something we want, it requires effort to overcome both our neurological impulse to keep things the same as well as our ingrained habitual patterns. When we try to resist resistance, we only generate more of it. We create an inner struggle that often leads to anger, frustration, stress, and anxiety. Resisting resistance doesn't help us move forward; instead, it negatively impacts both our health and well-being. The key to managing resistance and thereby better managing change is to face it and embrace it. Once you're able to observe your resistance, see whether there's anything you can learn from it. Are you resisting simply because of your natural preference for familiarity? Or are you resisting because something legitimately doesn't make sense?

Gain as much information as possible regarding the change and what it might entail. Ideally, this process is done with a mind that accepts the reality of constant change, enabling curiosity, rather than fear, to be the driver behind the investigative process. Awareness of your own resistance The second step is to be aware of any resistance to the change. If you think you don't have any resistance, think again. It's natural for us to resist change; there's nothing wrong with resistance. Resistance can be very instructive and can help us gain insight into how to better manage the change. When you become aware of any resistance, don't try to run from it or resist it. Observation of your resistance The third step is to observe the resistance. Seek to understand where it comes from and what might be underlying it. See if there's anything you can learn from it that might inform or enhance the change management process. Mindfully choose your response With a solid understanding of the change and your resistance to it, you can choose a response. This may mean you choose to fully embrace the change and let go of any resistance. It may also mean you choose to try to skillfully influence the change process by mindfully presenting other alternatives. It may mean you choose not to accept the change because you realize it's not in your best interest. Regardless of your choice, make the decision with a calm, clear mind. Act The final step is to take action in accordance with your choices. This is where you move forward. Although this step will help you better manage the change process, that doesn't mean it will be easy! It's helpful to acknowledge that it will be difficult to change habitual patterns. You'll likely have ongoing spikes of resistance and setbacks in the process. During this step, it's important to both identify and accept the support you need to manage the change.

Making Choices Follow the first rule of mental effectiveness and choose a task and stick with it. Notice the impact that not jumping back and forth between tasks can have on your energy. Leveraging Cycles Our mental energy naturally ebbs and flows throughout the day, in cycles that have a lot to do with our sleep, nutrition, and level of physical activity. We simply are not always at peak mental performance. For most people, energy levels are higher first thing in the morning, after a good night's rest.

There's no need to finish everything in front of you right this second. Avoid the Blood Sugar Rollercoaster Many of us, seeking a quick antidote to feeling sleepy, ride the blood sugar rollercoaster during the afternoon hours. An hour or two after lunch, we hit the afternoon slump---a fatigue our brains mis- takes for a lack of blood glucose. A natural and automatic reaction is to grab a snack, a cup of coffee, or an energy drink to quickly raise our energy levels. But a snack---and a sugary one in particular---can raise blood sugar levels too high, leading to mood swings, brain fog, and stress. After a short while, blood sugar levels plummet. A sense of panic results due to the stress, cortisol, and adrenaline released when fatigue and brain fog set in. Then we're right back where we started, at the bottom of the roller coaster, with our brains craving another fix of fast energy. The Mindful Minute Over time, allowing you a mindful minute before immediately snacking can mitigate the general craving that comes with natural tiredness. Next time you feel desire for food, pause. Allow yourself to mindfully observe the experience of desire. Allow the experience to be present, without engaging and giving in to it. This is not meant to impart strict discipline and impulse control, merely a moment of mindfulness before you eat. Ask yourself, what does it feel like? Where do you experience the feeling, in your stomach or elsewhere? Is the experience changing or does it stay the same? If after the minute, you're feeling the same desire, you may actually be hungry. In that case, eat. If there's little or no desire left, you weren't actually hungry. Your brain tried to trick you. But you were smarter, and dismantled the desire by simply allowing it to rise without engaging in it. When you're mindful of your food, awareness tells you when you have had enough. You tend to eat less. You also tend to enjoy food more, because you actually pay attention to it.","title":"Eating and Energy"},{"location":"Personal_Development/MIndfullness_at_work/#activity-and-energy","text":"When you have positive physical experiences, your mind smiles.

Relaxation---The Absence of Unnecessary Effort A relaxed body---one absent of unnecessary tension---has greater endurance and generally feels more pleasant. As you train, occasionally Activity and Energy scan your body for signs of unnecessary effort or tension. Then relax. The more relaxed you are, the more you can do and the more you'll enjoy it. While relaxation is also important for the mind to avoid thinking and distraction, the mind needs an object of focus. You need to have an anchor---and that anchor is usually your breath. While breathing is a great anchor while you're sitting still, it's equally powerful during physical activity. But breath alone may not be enough. Instead, it can be more effective to synchronize your breath with the natural rhythm of your physical activity. When you run or walk, synchronize your steps with your breath. Take a certain number of steps for each inhalation and each exhalation. This way, you can easily maintain a focused and steady rhythm for long periods. It's often easier than just focusing on your breathing. Focus and rhythm can be a big help, especially if you feel poorly or experience pain. Most unpleasantness comes from our thoughts. Thoughts come from physical sensations or other distractions. Your focus creates your reality. Focus on unpleasantness, and your reality will be unpleasant.

In reality, having emotional balance equates to not getting caught up in the natural ups and downs of our emotions. Emotional balance is a state of being aware of our emotions enough to manage them in a way that is gentle, honest, and wise. Mirroring others' emotions is normal; it's your mirror neurons at play. More about mirror neurons is presented in the mental strategy of Joy. But in short, when we face someone joyful, mirror neurons in our brains make us experience a similar joy. The same goes for anger, grief, and almost all other emotions. Most of us deal with our emotions by either suppressing them or acting them out. The thing about suppressing emotions is that they have to go somewhere. Like pressing down on a balloon, pushing your emotions down only means they will pop up again somewhere else. Additionally, suppressing emotions requires an enormous amount of mental energy---energy that's diverted from our own focus and clarity. Acting out our emotions, whether aggressively or passive aggressively, might feel good in the moment. But if acting out is effective at all, it's only in that moment. In the long run, acting out our emotions usually leads to disappointment, regret, or shame. In mindfulness training, we work to develop the mental capacity, the patience, and the courage to endure discomfort. At the same time, we learn to observe our emotions with some neutrality. We put some kind of distance between our emotions and ourselves. Instead of running on autopilot, being absorbed with emotion and caught in its grip, we take a moment to pause.

Without the ability to do so, we default to yesterday's perception of the market and the competition. We become complacent---and might just wake up to find ourselves behind the bus. A few natural traits stand between each of us and a beginner's mind: namely, habitual perception and cognitive rigidity. The automatic association between what's actually in front of you and what you've seen in the past---the neurological process called habitual perception---can be problematic. It means you often don't actually see what's right there in front of you. In fact, what you do see has much less to do with actual reality, and much more to do with the reality your mind creates based on your history and habits. In other words, you have programmed yourself to see reality in a certain way. Cognitive rigidity---the inflexibility created by automatically recalling our habitual perceptions---is not conducive to creativity. It doesn't help us innovate. Or help us to see new solutions to old challenges, let alone new solutions to new challenges. The ability to face reality as it is---or at least not be stuck in old ways of seeing things---is the essence of a beginner's mind. Without a beginner's mind, we lock ourselves inside our own experience; we stagnate in our mind's habitual perception. With a beginner's mind, we see things with fresh eyes and an open mind.

This may be fielding com- plaints from customers or confronting a surly coworker. Be aware of your reactions to these tasks and temper those reac- tions by purposefully limiting or delaying the gratification of the experiences you like, while more actively confronting the experiences you dislike. You train balance by being aware of your reaction to everything you experience, good, bad, and neutral. Notice the experiences you like and those you do not like, things where you experience attraction and things where you experience aversion. Just being aware of these reactions will lead to change.

Regardless of where the distraction comes from, the instructions for dealing with it are the same: Relax, Release, and Return. Relax: When you perceive you are distracted by a thought, sound, or sensation, notice whether it creates any tension any- where in your body. Try your best to release that tension. Relax.

During open awareness training, a sharpened focus helps generate insight into both the nature of the mind and how its performance can be optimized. With open awareness training, you develop a panoramic view that helps you see yourself, others, and every situation more objectively---allowing you to decide who and what gets your attention, and who and what does not. Open awareness is the ability to observe your mind. It is training in becoming familiar with the workings of the mind and how that causes us to experience challenges in life. Open awareness helps you not be a victim of circumstance---only able to react automatically to situations as they develop. Open awareness involves training for a new kind of relationship with your thoughts and the world around you. It engenders certain clarity in the mind, allowing you to stay one second ahead of your reactions, regardless of the situation. With open awareness, autopilot is no longer the default response mechanism. Instead, it catalyzes the ability to relate to the events in your mind, bringing a whole new sense of clarity and direction into your life and work. Training open awareness provides you with the opportunity to experience, with a depth of understanding, that your thoughts are the root cause of your problems. Open awareness gives sharp focus direction and intentionality. Together, sharp focus and open awareness can help you spend your time, energy, and attention mindfully, ultimately increasing your effectiveness in life and work. The essence of open awareness training is observing your thoughts, senses, emotions and tasks in a neutral way---like a mental observatory. As in focus training, start by sitting comfortably, as described under the guidance in the \"A\" for Anatomy. For a minute or two, direct your full attention toward your breathing, like in the focus training. Allow your mind to stabilize and settle. Count your breaths if it helps you let go of distractions. Check off one by one whether your mind has the three core qualities of relaxation, focus, and clarity. When you've reached some level of these qualities, you can begin to open your awareness. Let go of the attention on your breathing and open up to whatever may arise. When the first distraction attracts your attention---a sound, thought, physical sensation, or anything else---direct your full attention to it and use it as an anchor for your awareness. Observe the distraction neutrally, just as you did with your breathing. Don't think about it. Don't engage in it. Don't try to make it stay or go away. Simply observe it. If it helps, imagine observing the distractions as if they were waves on the beach. Notice when the distraction comes into focus. Notice that it's there. Notice when at some point it disappears or changes to something else. When a distraction disappears, you open up and are ready to receive the next one in the same way. If a distraction changes into something else, you follow the transformation neutrally. If at any point you find you're confused or overwhelmed by your distractions, pause, relax, release the distractions, and return your focus to your breath. After a few moments, when you've stabilized your focus, let go of your breathing and open your awareness again. At any time, you can always come back to the anchor and simply focus on your breath. Be prepared that you may need to come back to your breath again and again throughout your training to ensure you're not getting carried away by thoughts and distractions. If it's difficult to have a neutral approach to the distraction, that is, if you notice you start to engage with it, it can be helpful to give it a short mental label. For example, if a thought arises about something you need to buy, you can label it \"shopping\" and observe the experience of the thought without thinking about what it is and where you will get it. You can also use even simpler labels such as \"thought,\" \"sensation,\" and \"feeling,\" without qualifiers. While the instructions are simple, the challenge for many is observing thoughts, feelings, sensations, and emotions neutrally without engaging. In fact, many find training open awareness difficult, especially in the beginning. Use open awareness as a basis for your training for a couple of weeks as you develop your ability to be a neutral observer of your thoughts and experiences.

The more you come to grasp, in a meaningful way, the fact that everything changes, the easier it becomes to deal with negative things, because you know they will change. You will also place a higher value on the positive things you experience, appreciating them more while they last.

Someone who is overly dependent is just as dysfunctional as one who is overly independent. People who believe that their emotions should always be expressed and routinely acted upon are at very high risk for doing great harm to their partners and ruining their romantic relationships. Emotions need to be expressed. There can be no emotional connection between people without that. But emotions also need to be contained at times. The belief that \"if I feel it, I should act on it\" is a dangerous one unless it is also tempered by a parallel belief that \" I must evaluate which feelings to express, how to appropriately express them, and which ones to contain.\" Otherwise, we are nothing more than wild animals acting out our primitive impulses. Care is simple. It is kind. It is gracious. It is one human being seeing another human being and taking the time to acknowledge what one sees . It is taking the time to listen without trying to fix, rescue, analyze, problem-solve, or therapize. The health of a marriage depends on the balance of power and control within both partners, and between both partners. If I don't control my impulses enough, I will overpower you. If you don't exert your power enough, you will disappear. There Are Always Reasons and Payoffs for Our Unhealthy Behaviors; Otherwise We Wouldn't Engage in Them---Be Honest About What Those Reasons Are Talking about feelings isn't the same as expressing them. You know you are becoming a competent, healthy adult when you can choose what at times will be the exquisite pain and discomfort of fear, hurt, shame, loneliness, and sadness rather than hurt yourself, hurt others, or let others hurt you. the ability to self-regulate is especially important in the functioning of a healthy person, family, or society, and it is impossible to have deep relationships unless one can sit in the middle of one's loneliness, fear, hurt, shame, and sadness without acting out. Every human being is vastly capable of being both nasty and nice at various times throughout our lives. Our capacity for forgiveness and our capacity to make amends are boundless, if we let them be. What makes us spiritual beings is our ability to look back at what we have done to each other and to consider, with the wisdom of experience and age, how what seemed \"normal\" back then now seems cruel and inconsiderate; and then to have the chance to repair those wrongs or to forgive those wrongs done to us by others. Self-esteem = competence and acceptance + belonging Power and control Power is the capacity to influence. Control can be defined most simply as a reciprocal to power, that is, as the capacity to restrain or regulate influence. People who have learned to combine grace and power spend the majority of their time engaging in neither of these painful patterns of behavior. They find ways to meet their needs and the needs of their families while remaining socially appropriate, respectful, and kind; while having personal integrity and decency; and yet the individuals involved remain powerful, competent, and effective. The human experience of power/control is the experience of living as a self interacting with a world. . . . If control becomes excessive in a relationship, the opportunity for individual self-expression or self-actualization is reduced; when power dominates, the stage is set for competition and conflict. In human interactions that are positive and effective, a balance of power/control is achieved. The result is an experience of mutuality regulation is a shared endeavor. In the experience of mutuality, each individual can retain a sense of self-identity and worth while simultaneously feeling connected and even intimate with others as part of a larger relationship system.

The violence and rage that we perpetrate on others happens, not because of something the other person does, but because of something we do not do---that is, control ourselves. We respond very quickly to what is going on around us and inside of us. We're going to feel what we feel whether we think we will or not. In most cases, once we feel the feelings, Homo sapiens have the great good fortune to be able to choose how we further respond because we have a neocortex.

If control becomes excessive in a relationship, the opportunity for individual self-expression or self-actualization is reduced; when power dominates, the stage is set for competition and conflict. In human interactions that are positive and effective, a balance of power/control is achieved. The result is an experience of mutuality regulation is a shared endeavor.

In each area of my life, did I do those things that are easy to do, and easy not to do? Did I continue my momentum on the success curve?\" Time is the force that magnifies those simple daily disciplines into massive success. There is a natural progression to success: plant, cultivate, harvest---and the central step, cultivate, can only happen over the course of time. No genuine success in life is instant. Life is not a clickable link. To grasp how the slight edge works, you have to view your actions through the eyes of time. Success is not the key to happiness. Happiness is the key to success Daily: Each morning, write down three things you're grateful for. Not the same three every day; find three new things to write about. That trains your brain to search your circumstances and hunt for the positive. Journal for two minutes a day about one positive experience you've had over the past twenty-four hours. Write down every detail you can remember; this causes your brain to literally reexperience the experience, which doubles its positive impact. Meditate daily. Nothing fancy; just stop all activity, relax, and watch your breath go in and out for two minutes. This trains your brain to focus where you want it to, and not get distracted by negativity in your environment. Do a random act of kindness over the course of each day. To make this simple, Shawn often recommends a specific act of kindness: at the start of each day, take two minutes to write an email to someone you know praising them or thanking them for something they did. Exercise for fifteen minutes daily. Simple cardio, even a brisk walk, has a powerful antidepressant impact, in many cases stronger (and more long-lasting) than an actual antidepressant!

People who self-correct early on have an advantage over those who spend ages fiddling with the perfect set-up and crossing their fingers that their plans will work out. There's no such thing as the ideal training. There's more than one life goal. There's no perfect business strategy, no optimal stock portfolio, no one right job. They're all myths.

The 1st Alternative is my way, the 2nd Alternative is your way. By synergizing, we can go on to a 3rd Alternative---our way, a higher and better way to resolve the conflict. Without synergy: 1 + 1 \\< 2 With synergy: 1 + 1 > 2 The natural principle that the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. Rather than going my way or your way, we take the path of synergy to higher and more productive results. You and I together are far greater than we are alone. Our paradigms govern our behavior, which in turn governs the consequences of our actions. We GET results based on what we DO, and what we DO depends on how we SEE the world around us. 4 step process of 3rd alternative thinking To arrive at a 3rd Alternative, I must first practice self-awareness and value the different viewpoint that you represent. Then I must seek to understand that viewpoint thoroughly. Only then can we move up to synergy. I see myself Seeing myself as a unique human being capable of independent judgment and action. I am not merely \"my side\" of a controversy. I am more than the sum of my prejudices, party, and preconceptions. My thoughts are not predetermined by my family, my culture, or my company. I can mentally stand apart from myself and evaluate how my paradigms are influencing my actions. I see myself as a creative, self-aware human being who is more than the \"side\" I favor in a conflict. I might share certain beliefs or belong to certain groups, but these do not define me. I choose my own \"story.\" What's my story? Do I need to change the script? Where might I have blind spots about myself? How has my cultural programming influenced my thinking? What are my real motives? Are my assumptions accurate? In what ways are my assumptions incomplete? Am I contributing to an outcome---an end to the story---that I really want? I see you This is about seeing others as people instead of things. When we look at others, what do we see? Do we see an individual, or do we see age, gender, race, politics, religion, disability, national origin, or sexual orientation? Do we see a member of an \"out group\" or an \"in group\"? Or do we really see the uniqueness, the power, the gifts of every diverse individual? I See You. I see a whole human being unlike any other, a person of innate worth, endowed with talents, passions, and strengths that are irreplaceable. You are more than your \"side\" in a conflict. You deserve dignity and my respect. I seek you out This paradigm is about deliberately seeking out conflicting views instead of avoiding or defending yourself against them. If a person of your intelligence and competence and commitment disagrees with me, then there must be something to your disagreement that I don't understand, and I need to understand it. You have a perspective, a frame of reference I need to look at. Instead of seeing your different viewpoint as a threat, I avidly seek to learn from you. If a person of your character and intelligence differs from me, I need to listen to you. I listen empathically until I genuinely understand you. The heart of each one is tender, and when we touch that tenderness, we are in a sacred place. \"I Seek You Out\" starts with the principle that truth is complicated and that everybody likely has a little slice of it. \"Truth is never pure and rarely simple,\" said Oscar Wilde. No one has it all. 3rd Alternative thinkers recognize that the more slices of truth they have, the more they see things as they really are. So these thinkers deliberately seek out different slices of truth. If you have truth that I don't have, why wouldn't I come and find you so you can teach me? Talking stick The Talking Stick. An ancient Native American tradition, the Talking Stick is a symbol of peaceful communication. So long as the speaker holds the stick in hand, no one may interrupt until the speaker feels heard and understood. Whoever holds the Talking Stick has within his hands the sacred power of words. Only he can speak while he holds the stick; the other council members must remain silent. The eagle feather tied to the Talking Stick gives him the courage and wisdom to speak truthfully and wisely. The rabbit fur on the end of the stick reminds him that his words must come from his heart and that they must be soft and warm. The blue stone will remind him that the Great Spirit hears the message of his heart as well as the words he speaks. The shell, iridescent and ever changing, reminds him that all creation changes---the days, the seasons, the years---and people and situations change, too. The four colors of beads---yellow for the sunrise (east), red for the sunset (west), white for the snow (north) and green for the earth (south)---are symbolic of the powers of the universe he has in his hands at the moment to speak what is in his heart. Attached to the stick are strands of hair from the great buffalo. He who speaks may do so with the power and strength of this great animal. Empathic Listening . In a conflict, we are usually thinking about our own rebuttals and responses while the other person talks. We can't hear each other through that \"wall.\" By contrast, an empathic listener seeks to understand the thoughts and feelings of the other. Unless you've understood me, with my points and my feelings so well that you could make my argument for me---you haven't actually heard anything. In the paradigm \"I Seek You Out,\" I argue with you to try out ideas, not to impose them. I use argument as a vehicle for learning, not as a weapon. My purpose is not to score points on you in the weary old game of one-upmanship but to change the game. Steps Go to the other side and say, \"You see things differently. I need to listen to you.\" Pay the price to understand. Give your full attention. Don't multitask while you're listening. Don't judge, evaluate, analyze, advise, toss in your footnotes, commiserate, critique, or quarrel. The speakers don't need you on their side. All they need is your positive regard for them. Be quiet. You don't have to provide an answer, a verdict, a solution, or a \"fix.\" Free yourself from all that pressure. Just sit back and listen. Speak only to keep the flow going. Say things like \"Tell me more,\" \"Go on,\" or just \"Hm.\" Pay close attention to emotions. Affirm feelings: \"You must feel (sorry, angry, hurt, worn out, anxious, disappointed, baffled, confused, betrayed, unsure, suspicious, skeptical, worried, frustrated) about this.\" Use a Talking Stick---literally or figuratively---if that will help. Remember, you're listening to a story. When you go to a movie, you don't interrupt and argue with the story and talk back to the screen. (If you do, you'll be asked to leave---and good riddance!) You're involved, your sense of reality is suspended, you're almost in a trance. Be ready to learn. If you're open, you'll gain insights that will light up your own mind and complement your own perspective. Changing your viewpoint due to more data is natural---it is not a sign of weakness. Make sure you really do understand. If necessary, tell the story back to the storyteller. Restate what you thought you heard. Talk about the feelings you perceived. Ask if he feels that you have thoroughly understood where he's coming from. If not, try again until he is satisfied. Show some gratitude. It's a great compliment to be invited into the mind and heart of another human being. And it's a real benefit to you because you've grasped a slice of truth you didn't understand before. I Synergize With You This last paradigm is about going for a solution that's better than anyone has thought of before, rather than getting caught up in the cycle of attacking one another. Once we understand each other fully, we are in a position to go for synergy, to find a solution that is better than anything we've come up with individually. Synergy is rapid, creative, collaborative problem solving. Steps to synergy Step 1: Ask the 3rd Alternative Question The first step in the synergy process is to ask the 3rd Alternative Question: \"Are you willing to go for a solution that is better than either one of us has in mind?\" Step 2: Define Criteria of Success Step 3. Create 3rd Alternatives Step 4: Arrive at Synergy Values Beware of pride. Let go of needing always to be \"right.\" Your grasp on reality is always partial anyway. Allow yourself to achieve the important breakthroughs in relationships and creative solutions that will never likely be realized if you stubbornly hold on to being \"right.\" Learn to say \"I'm sorry.\" Do it quickly once you realize you've fallen short or hurt someone. Be sincere and don't hold back. And don't go just half way. Apologize fully, take responsibility, and express your desire to understand. Be quick to forgive perceived slights. Remember, you choose whether or not to be offended. If you feel offended, let it go. Make and keep very small promises to yourself and others. Take baby steps. As you create a pattern of doing so, make and keep bigger promises. Your own integrity will become your greatest source of security and strength. Spend time in nature. Go on long walks. Create space in your life every day for reflection on the synergies of the world around you. Read widely---it's one of the best ways to make mental connections and get insights that can lead to 3rd Alternatives. Exercise often, each day if possible; and eat healthy food, with balance and moderation. The body is the instrument of the mind and spirit. Get enough sleep, at least 7 to 8 hours daily. Science tells us that the brain grows new connections during sleep, which is why we often awake with sparkling new ideas. And you'll find yourself so much more able to give the emotional, mental, and spiritual energy needed to create 3^rd^ Alternatives. Study inspiring or sacred literature. Ponder, meditate, or pray. Insights will come. Make quiet time for yourself to think through creative 3rd Alternative solutions to your challenges. Express love and appreciation to those with whom you associate. Listen empathically to them. Devote time to learning about them, what is important to them, what is their story. You have two ears and one mouth: use them proportionally. Practice being generous with others---with your time, your heart, your forgiveness, and your affirmation. Be wise and generous in sharing your resources with those in need. Be generous with and forgive yourself. We all have weakness. We all have strength. Look to the future and move on. All these things will cultivate within you a spirit of abundance. Avoid comparing yourself to others. Just don't. You are unique. You are of infinite worth and have great potential. Define your own exceptional mission in life. Just be true to it, be yourself, and serve others and the world simply and magnificently! Be grateful. Express it. Learn to become enthusiastically relentless about discovering how to create great wins for others---wins that increase their peace, their happiness, and their prosperity. It will become infectious, and you may often find others seeking the same for you. This is the key to producing remarkable synergies. When things aren't going well, take a break, take a walk around the block, get a good night's sleep, and come back at it with the freshness and perspective of a new day. If you truly can't reach win-win, remember that \"no deal\" in some cases is the best alternative. When it comes to other people, their reactions, their weaknesses, and peculiarities, just smile a lot. And when it comes to your teenagers, remind yourself, \"This, too, shall pass.\" Never stop believing in the possibility of the 3rd Alternative.","title":"The third alternative"},{"location":"Personal_Development/The_third_alternative/#synergy","text":"Most conflicts are two-sided (Black or White).

If a person of your intelligence and competence and commitment disagrees with me, then there must be something to your disagreement that I don't understand, and I need to understand it. You have a perspective, a frame of reference I need to look at. Instead of seeing your different viewpoint as a threat, I avidly seek to learn from you. If a person of your character and intelligence differs from me, I need to listen to you. I listen empathically until I genuinely understand you. The heart of each one is tender, and when we touch that tenderness, we are in a sacred place. \"I Seek You Out\" starts with the principle that truth is complicated and that everybody likely has a little slice of it. \"Truth is never pure and rarely simple,\" said Oscar Wilde. No one has it all. 3rd Alternative thinkers recognize that the more slices of truth they have, the more they see things as they really are. So these thinkers deliberately seek out different slices of truth. If you have truth that I don't have, why wouldn't I come and find you so you can teach me?","title":"I seek you out"},{"location":"Personal_Development/The_third_alternative/#talking-stick","text":"The Talking Stick. An ancient Native American tradition, the Talking Stick is a symbol of peaceful communication. So long as the speaker holds the stick in hand, no one may interrupt until the speaker feels heard and understood. Whoever holds the Talking Stick has within his hands the sacred power of words. Only he can speak while he holds the stick; the other council members must remain silent. The eagle feather tied to the Talking Stick gives him the courage and wisdom to speak truthfully and wisely. The rabbit fur on the end of the stick reminds him that his words must come from his heart and that they must be soft and warm. The blue stone will remind him that the Great Spirit hears the message of his heart as well as the words he speaks. The shell, iridescent and ever changing, reminds him that all creation changes---the days, the seasons, the years---and people and situations change, too. The four colors of beads---yellow for the sunrise (east), red for the sunset (west), white for the snow (north) and green for the earth (south)---are symbolic of the powers of the universe he has in his hands at the moment to speak what is in his heart. Attached to the stick are strands of hair from the great buffalo. He who speaks may do so with the power and strength of this great animal. Empathic Listening . In a conflict, we are usually thinking about our own rebuttals and responses while the other person talks. We can't hear each other through that \"wall.\" By contrast, an empathic listener seeks to understand the thoughts and feelings of the other. Unless you've understood me, with my points and my feelings so well that you could make my argument for me---you haven't actually heard anything. In the paradigm \"I Seek You Out,\" I argue with you to try out ideas, not to impose them. I use argument as a vehicle for learning, not as a weapon.

You don't have to provide an answer, a verdict, a solution, or a \"fix.\" Free yourself from all that pressure. Just sit back and listen. Speak only to keep the flow going. Say things like \"Tell me more,\" \"Go on,\" or just \"Hm.\" Pay close attention to emotions. Affirm feelings: \"You must feel (sorry, angry, hurt, worn out, anxious, disappointed, baffled, confused, betrayed, unsure, suspicious, skeptical, worried, frustrated) about this.\" Use a Talking Stick---literally or figuratively---if that will help. Remember, you're listening to a story. When you go to a movie, you don't interrupt and argue with the story and talk back to the screen. (If you do, you'll be asked to leave---and good riddance!) You're involved, your sense of reality is suspended, you're almost in a trance. Be ready to learn. If you're open, you'll gain insights that will light up your own mind and complement your own perspective. Changing your viewpoint due to more data is natural---it is not a sign of weakness. Make sure you really do understand. If necessary, tell the story back to the storyteller. Restate what you thought you heard. Talk about the feelings you perceived. Ask if he feels that you have thoroughly understood where he's coming from. If not, try again until he is satisfied. Show some gratitude.

Remember, you choose whether or not to be offended. If you feel offended, let it go. Make and keep very small promises to yourself and others. Take baby steps. As you create a pattern of doing so, make and keep bigger promises. Your own integrity will become your greatest source of security and strength. Spend time in nature. Go on long walks. Create space in your life every day for reflection on the synergies of the world around you. Read widely---it's one of the best ways to make mental connections and get insights that can lead to 3rd Alternatives. Exercise often, each day if possible; and eat healthy food, with balance and moderation. The body is the instrument of the mind and spirit. Get enough sleep, at least 7 to 8 hours daily. Science tells us that the brain grows new connections during sleep, which is why we often awake with sparkling new ideas. And you'll find yourself so much more able to give the emotional, mental, and spiritual energy needed to create 3^rd^ Alternatives. Study inspiring or sacred literature. Ponder, meditate, or pray.

Listen empathically to them. Devote time to learning about them, what is important to them, what is their story. You have two ears and one mouth: use them proportionally. Practice being generous with others---with your time, your heart, your forgiveness, and your affirmation. Be wise and generous in sharing your resources with those in need. Be generous with and forgive yourself. We all have weakness. We all have strength. Look to the future and move on. All these things will cultivate within you a spirit of abundance. Avoid comparing yourself to others. Just don't. You are unique. You are of infinite worth and have great potential. Define your own exceptional mission in life. Just be true to it, be yourself, and serve others and the world simply and magnificently! Be grateful. Express it. Learn to become enthusiastically relentless about discovering how to create great wins for others---wins that increase their peace, their happiness, and their prosperity. It will become infectious, and you may often find others seeking the same for you. This is the key to producing remarkable synergies. When things aren't going well, take a break, take a walk around the block, get a good night's sleep, and come back at it with the freshness and perspective of a new day. If you truly can't reach win-win, remember that \"no deal\" in some cases is the best alternative. When it comes to other people, their reactions, their weaknesses, and peculiarities, just smile a lot.

Depends on: Diversity (see further down for details) Applied to chemical elements: Mixing the same type of elements will not lead to anything interesting. Mixing few components together leads to new (sometimes emergent) phenomena. Mixing a lot of elements together leads to a mess. Connectedness (how many people a person connects to) Interdependence (whether other entities influence actions) Adaptation/Learning Complex systems don't lie at the extremes of those attributes but at a moderate level. It's easier to analyse games/models with only two players or an infinite number of numbers since they are not complex. A complex system produces interesting non-periodic patterns and emergent structures and functionalities. Social systems are usually complex because their attributes (diversity, connectedness, interdependence, adaptation) at a moderate level. Classification of systems/models based on: the rules followed by its parts the initial state of the system family at a dinner table family in a car for 36 hours Classifications: single point equilibria (ball in a bowl) regular patterns (stop light) chaotic extremely sensitive to initial conditions (starting at the same point under slightly different conditions will end up at a completely different point) complex no regular behaviour no regular pattern structure not easily discernible Diversity Diversity measures Variation average squared distance from the mean Entropy Capture the evenness of a distribution across types. (kinda variation for categorical values) Also called Simpson's index Does not take the differences between the types into account (e.g. differences between apples and peers vs. elephants and apples) E.g. colors of tables There is 1/3 red 1/3 white and 1/3 white tables Square each result (i.e. 1/3^2^*3) = 1/3 Take the inverse of the number = 3/1 The entropy is higher the more types there are The entropy is lower if the proportions of the type are unequal (more of one type as compared to the others) Distance Take into account differences between types (see entropy which doesn't do this) Assume a pre-existing distance function between pairs of types. Some way to measure how equal the types are The more distance there is between the types the more diverse is the whole set of entities. Attribute Take into account differences between types (see entropy which doesn't do this) Identify the attributes of each type in a set and count up the total number of unique attributes How diversity gets produced in complex systems Positive feedbacks Diversity causes more diversity The more diversity you start with (e.g. more types of materials), the more diversity you can produce. Week selective pressures Not like in a bank where you need to dress a certain way Different landscapes Thinking of possible actions actors can take as moves along geographic coordinates. The fitness/success of the moves can be thought of as elevation in the landscape. The actors objective is to climb and search for elevations on the landscape with the ambition to find the highest point. Mount Fuyi (only one peak) Rugged (multiple peaks) Dancing landscapes Changing/shifting height landscapes e.g. through competition or innovation Diversity produces innovation Combinations: Imagine Thomas Edison had 100 jars of elements on his shelf in his laboratory. To choose 2 jars there 100 choices to take one jar and 99 choices to take the 2^nd^ jar. Since order does matter (i.e. element1 + element2 is the same as element2 + element1) we need to divide the result by two: Numbers of combinations to pick 2 out of 100 = 100 * 99 /1* 2 = 4950 3 out of 100 = 100 * 99 * 98 / 1*2*3 = 4 out of 100 = 100 * 99 * 98 * 97 / 1*2*3*4 Also diversity of thought/ideas i.e. different ways of seeing or representing things can lead to reaching another peak. Diversity produces robustness Robustness = Ability to maintain functionality despite disturbance Variation produces robustness Having a set of screwdrivers enables you to respond to fix any screw that is loose. Variation in beaks of a population of birds of a specific type makes them robust against environmental changes (e.g. Darwin's finches) Diversity produces robustness Set of different tools enables you even better to respond to any problems. The more species there are, the more likely it is that at least one of them will survive any kind of change. Explore vs. Exploit Complex systems consist of agents/parts that have interdependent rules and payoffs, which create robustness and emergent phenomena. There is a fundamental trade-off for the agents in the system between explore and exploit. Exploration = Searching for better solutions (continue to search for new solutions) Exploitation = Taking advantage of what you know (use the information you found previously) Restaurant example:\\ There are lots of different restaurants. If you keep searching/trying out new one's your result will reflect the average quality of all restaurants. If you use the knowledge you have and keep going only to the restaurants you already know and like you could miss out on something really good. Ideally one should balance exploration against exploitation. Rugged vs. mount fuyi landscape context: The actor's objective is to climb and search for elevations on the landscape with the ambition to find the highest point. There are only limited time/resources to find the highest point therefore there must be a balance between exploration and exploitation. Going only in the direction that leads uphill and stay if there is no such direction will only lead to the first local peak in a rugged landscape, but is not effective to find the highest peak (greedy algorithm). Simulated annealing Annealing is a process used to harden glass and metals (E.g. tempered glass or hardened steel ), or to make crystals. Spin glass -> checker board of particles pointing upwards = 1, pointing downwards = -1 The goal is to change the particles such that they all point in the same direction. The particles/agents actually all want to point in the same direction. If the material is too cold the particles are stuck in a frustrated state. If the material's temperature is increased the agents/particles are set free to move and try to align themselves in terms of the direction they are pointing with their neighbours. This will cause neighbourhoods of particles to point into the same direction. At this stage the material is made gradually colder again. This will cause the bigger regions to be fixed. But the boundaries where the particles are pointing in opposite directions are still moving and will eventually all point in the same direction at which point the particles are organized and fixed since the material is cold again. Simulated annealing applied to the hiker trying to find the highest point in a rugged landscape: High temperature = the hiker's moves cause a lot of mistakes (going downhill). The hiker will move around all over the place doing exploration. Low temperature = less mistakes (mainly uphill moves). On rugged landscapes the agents should start wit high temperature (more exploration) and then gradually do more and more exploitation to end up on a high local peak. With dancing landscapes, the agents can never stop exploring since a peak can turn into a valley. This is causing complexity. What is preventing the system to do too much exploration is that too much exploration would cause randomness which would cause more and more agents to find local peaks (exploitation). The benefits from exploration declines as there is more randomness and makes more sense to exploit instead. Applied to job search or other searches it might mean that it makes sense to explore more, if you have the resources to do so. Emergence Spontaneous creation of order and functionality from the bottom up (not controlled from top-down). E.g. specific fire-flies that blink at the same time by syncing only with their neighbour and hence reaching the whole group to blink at the same time. Rather than by a central conductor that tells them when to blink. Something that is more than the sum of its parts. Types of emergence Simple or complex Simple -> macro level property in an equilibrium system (e.g. wetness of water, a single water molecule cannot be wet) Complex -> macro level property that exists in complex systems not in equilibrium. (e.g. slime moles can form a snail like organism or pile up (breaking the symmetry since they know act differently even though they are all the same) Strong or weak emergence Strong -> what occurs at the macro level cannot be deduced from the interactions at the micro level (e.g. consciousness) Weak -> what occurs at the macro level cannot be expected from the interactions at the micro level, but can be explained once it is observed. (e.g. slime moles) Culture Definition: Shared set of beliefs, behaviours, and routines. Functions: Cultures allow people to know how others will behave. People know how to behave in novel situations. Culture arises through series of coordination games (higher pay-off if we pick the same) in conjunction with consistent choices (doing similar things across different domains), builds characteristics of a specific culture (e.g. Americans are more risk-taking than French). Networks Functions of networks How quickly does information diffuse across a network? Are the networks that emerge robust to failures? Random failures (internet is robust to random failure) Strategic attacks Feedbacks and externalities Feedback -> dependencies between the same actions Externalities -> dependencies between different actions (e.g. the more flowers the more vases are needed). There are positive and negative externalities. Positive feedback (more creates more, actions that create more of the same) can lead to tipping points Negative feedback (more creates less, gas prices increase -> less people buy gas -> gas prizes go down) can create stability Combinations of positive feedback and negative externalities can create path-dependence Path-dependence: future outcomes depend on the actions along the way. Outcomes in path-dependent processes can be difficult to understand. Usually based on threshold rule. E.g. what is the % of people that run for the exit for me to run for the exit, too? In complex systems (that are diverse) the extreme thresholds (at the tails of the distribution) can have a big impact on the behaviour of the system: E.g. people leaving mall based on how many other people are leaving. If the threshold is j for every j person (threshold:personN: 1:1, 2:2, ....) then there will be a cascade effect if only one person leaves that will make everyone follow. As compared to everyone having a threshold of 5, where nothing happens until at least 5 people leave. The same effect can lead to stock market crashes (the system is tipping) and segregated neighbourhoods (even though individual tolerance levels are pretty high) There won't be a tipping that moves the system back into the other direction. Self organized criticality Systems self organize if the aggregation of individual actions produced an organized pattern at the macro level (e.g. bird flocks, fish shoals). A system is set to be critical if small events trigger large cascades. If a system self organizes into a critical state it is called self-organized criticality. Central limit theorem if we add or average samples of individual independent events, they will be normally distributed (e.g. weight of loaf of bread). Regardless of their distribution They only need to have finite variance (not too extreme) This contributes to the stability of society since it makes events predictable (there are usually not many events that deviate by large from the mean). Power law distributions Some events are not normally distributed but power laws(e.g. cost overrun of projects, war size, floods, earth quake). In a power law distribution huge events are not likely, but they can occur. Event sizes follow a power law if the probability of an event of size x is proportional to x raised to some negative power. (e.g. with an exponent of 2, the probability of an event with the size of 100 is 1/100\\^2. If you measure how long it takes to return to 0 in a game where I get 1\\$ for heads for a coin flip and you get 1\\$ for tail it will resemble a power law distribution. Most of the time it will only take few steps to go back to 0\\$ but some times it will take a long time. Per Bak's sand pile model of self-organized criticality In reality (if not simulated on a computer) the sand box model better works with rice. If you drop individual rice corns on a square table rice piles up on the table. A pile is going to build up. At one point the pile gets high enough so that additional rice corns will cause an avalanche causing some of the rice corns to drop to the floor. Most of the time there will be only few rice grains dropping to the floor. But some times there will be huge avalanches. The distribution of the avalanche sizes will follow a power law. If we replace the table in the sand pile model with a checker board and the sand with people from a group called bridge player anonymous. Every person will drop on a specific square of the checker board. Members of the group would like to avoid meeting in groups greater than 4. Because of 4 of them meet on a square they might want to start a game of bridge. If at any point 4 people of the group do meet at the same square they will go off in 4 different directions. Eventually this system will self-organize into a critical state where dropping additional people will lead to huge cascades of movements (similar to the avalanches within the sand pile model) because of the connectedness and interdependence within the system . Avoiding critical events from happening As connectedness and interdependence increases within the world these distributions become more likely to emerge. This can be prevented by Reducing connectedness (e.g. separating parts of a system in order to avoid cascade effects in case of emergencies) avoiding systems to reach a critical stage (e.g. preventing cars entering a motor way if it's getting too busy). Monitoring systems in order to recognize and release the build up of tension (e.g. monitoring political alliances). How do traffic jams happen? If a car slows down when there are many other cars driving behind it, the others cars will have to slow down too. Even if the car in front will accelerate again it will take the other cars much longer to take up speed again. It might take long enough for others cars driving behind the lane of cars also having to queue behind the same lane. This can then cascade down to more cars causing a traffic jam. First world war The arch duke of Austria-Hungary is assassinated by supposedly some group (black hand) from Serbia in Sarajevo. They give Serbia an (unreasonable) ultimatum. Russia is an ally of Serbia and Germany is an ally of Austria-Hungary As soon as Serbia rejects the ultimatum Austria-Hungary declares war on Serbia Russia and Germany join to support their allies. Also France is an ally of Russia and Serbia and joins the war. Later also Britain and Japan joined to help Russia, Serbia, and France Where does randomness come from? Engineered (e.g. Rand() in Excel) or lottery system.

Each prisoner is in solitary confinement with no means of communicating with the other. The prosecutors lack sufficient evidence to convict the pair on the principal charge, but they have enough to convict both on a lesser charge. Simultaneously, the prosecutors offer each prisoner a bargain. Each prisoner is given the opportunity either to betray the other by testifying that the other committed the crime, or to cooperate with the other by remaining silent. The possible outcomes are: If A and B each betray the other, each of them serves 10 years in > prison If A betrays B but B remains silent, A will be set free and B will > serve 15 years in prison If A remains silent but B betrays A, A will serve 15 years in prison > and B will be set free If A and B both remain silent, both of them will serve only one year > in prison (on the lesser charge). \u00bd Cooperate Defect Cooperate -1,-1 -15,0 Defect 0,-15 -10,-10 If your opponent cooperates your best choice is to defect (-1 vs. 0 payoff) If your opponent defects your best choice is the defect too (-15 vs. -10) To always defect is the best choice (-10,-10) = Nash equilibrium The dilemma occurs because individual's rationality does not lead to the overall best choice (-1,-1) What is best for the group (group rationality) is not always equal to a result based on each of the individual's rationality choices.

Economics supply and demand Laissez-faire argument Game theory: The agreement reached in (3) might not be sustainable Ways to achieve the best outcome for society 1) Mechanism/Market Design: Since game theory predicts outcomes based on the rules of a game one can reverse engineer the rules that will achieve a good outcome. In that way a system can be designed in such a way that players have an incentive to achieve a good outcome. Cooperation in long term relationship Example with two gas stations that are right next to each other. Assumptions: Same product Same unit cost (production cost) = 2\\$ If the price is different all customers go to the cheaper stations If the price is equal all customers will be split equally The Nash equilibrium in this case is both gas stations charging \\$2. If one gas station will increase the price customers will keep going to the cheaper station. If one gas station is trying to undercut \\$2, they will not gain either since they will decrease their profit (making it negative). The above is only true if the game is playing paid only once. Since the game is being played continuously, they are establishing a long-term relationship. Same players Play the same game continuously Repeated game. If the game played every day is a price competition, it's also called \"stage game\". To evaluate the impact of this strategy we need to take a discounted future payoff into consideration (a payoff today is worth less than a payoff tomorrow). What happens if one gas stations decides to undercut the prices of the other on 1^st^ March? Brand and reputation as substitute for long term relationship In a situation where there is no long term relationship like for a high priced restaurant in a tourist area with a low amount of returning customers (same applies for any low frequent high cost purchase). The restaurant can only establish a high price (expecting high quality in return) by reputation/brand since customers will need to trust that the quality of the food will match the high price and they cannot punish the restaurant by not coming back. On the other hand the customers can punish the restaurants by giving them a bad review which lowers their reputation in turn.","title":"Game Theory"},{"location":"Process_System_Models/Game_Theory/#definitions","text":"https://www.coursera.org/learn/game-theory-introduction Strategic Situation -> What is best for you depends on what others do.

By dividing 72 by the annual rate of return, investors obtain a rough estimate of how many years it will take for the initial investment to duplicate itself. Exponential growth: If you start with 1 penny and double it every day you have more than 10 Million after 31 days Why do some countries not grow? Growth requires a strong central government to protect capital and investment BUT that government cannot be controlled by a select few. Extraction (by protected government supporters) limits growth by lowering investment and capital. Increases in innovation means less labor is required. Growth requires creative destruction Growth rates are supported by innovation in the long run. Innovation Teams: Teams have different perspectives and different heuristics, and all that diversity makes them better than individuals on average. Recombination: Big Idea: Solutions from one problem and a solution from another problem are combined to make a better solution. Recombining solutions from a number of subproblems yields better solutions. Culture Summary: Basic Cultural properties: there\\'s a lot of difference between cultures, and those difference may arise because the fact that people need to coordinate within groups with which they interact. There\\'s also consistency within cultures, and that happens because it gets cognitively easier to do the same behavior in lots of different domains. And then third, we see a lot of heterogeneity within cultures. And that happens, as we saw by using a Markov analysis on our model, because if people just make small mistakes or occasionally try an innovation, those differences are going to propagate through the population in two ways; within an individual and across individuals. And that\\'s going to give us a lot of within-culture heterogeneity. So cultures differ between themselves. Cultures differ within themselves. But they still have this consistency. They have what you might call a cultural signature. These very simple models combined with our tools of Lyapunov functions and Markov processes have helped us understand why that happens. Condorcet\\'s Jury Theorem Condorcet\\'s jury theorem states that given a group of voters (a \\\"jury\\\") independently choosing by majority vote between a correct outcome with probability and an incorrect one with probability : 1. If (so that each voter is more likely to vote correctly that incorrectly), adding more voters increases the probability that the majority chooses correctly and the probability of a correct decision approaches 1 as the number of voters increases; 2. If (so that each voter is less likely to vote incorrectly than correctly), adding more voters decreases the probability that the majority chooses correctly and the probability of a correct decision is maximized for a jury of size one. Terminal velocity Terminal velocity is the maximum velocity attainable by an object as it falls through a fluid ( air is the most common example). Falling skydivers reach terminal velocities of 200 mph. Terminal velocities scale with the inverse of mass. Assume that a skydiver has a mass 400 times larger than the stuffed cheetah. For a heavy object, the terminal velocity is generally greater than a light object. This is because air resistance is proportional to the falling body\\'s velocity squared. The square root of 400 equals 20. Therefore, the terminal velocity of the stuffed cheetah will equal 200 mph divided by 20, or 10 mph. Object Mass Terminal velocity Sky diver 100 kg 200 kph Stuffed animal 100/400 = .25 kg 200 kph / Sqrt(100 kg / .25 kg) = 10 kph https://hypertextbook.com/facts/1998/JianHuang.shtml Entropy Entropy measures the uncertainty associated with a probability distribution over outcomes. It therefore also measures surprise. Entropy differs from variance, which measures the dispersion of a set or distribution of numerical values. Uncertainty correlates with dispersion, but the two differ. Distributions with high uncertainty have nontrivial probabilities over many outcomes. Those outcomes need not have numerical values. Distributions with high dispersion take on extreme numerical values. Capture the evenness of a distribution across types. (kinda variation for categorical values) Also called Simpson's index Does not take the differences between the types into account (e.g. differences between apples and peers vs. elephants and apples) E.g. colors of tables There is 1/3 red 1/3 white and 1/3 white tables Square each result (i.e. 1/3^2^*3) = 1/3 Take the inverse of the number = 3/1 The entropy is higher the more types there are The entropy is lower if the proportions of the type are unequal (more of one type as compared to the others) Classes of outcomes Equilibrium Cyclic Random Complex A pencil resting on a desk is in equilibrium. The planets orbiting the sun are in a cycle. A sequence of coin flips is random, so are (approximately) stock prices on the New York Stock Exchange, as we shall learn in the next chapter. Finally, the neuronal firings in a person's brain are complex; they do not fire randomly, nor do they fire in a fixed pattern. Bernoulli A player who makes 46% of his three-pointers has about a 1/1000probability of making nine in a row (0.46^9^). If that player keeps taking three-pointers, then in a ten-year NBA career (about 800 games), the odds of not making nine in a row at least once (0.999^800^) are about 47%. Networks Degree Measure of connectedness of a network. For one node it is the number of nodes it is connected to. For a network it is the average degree of all nodes. But can also be measured as: 2 x # Edges (because each edge connects to nodes) / Nodes A network has 50 nodes and 100 edges. What is the Average Degree of the network? 2 * 100 / 50 = 4 Node = Dots Edges = Connections Node # friends A 2 B 3 C 2 D 1 Average 2 Node Friends # Friend\u2019s friends Average of friend\u2019s friends A B C 3 2 2.5 B A C D 2 2 1 1.66 C A B 2 3 2.5 D B 3 3 Average 2.4 Numbers of triangles (see below) over of all possible triangles Number of possible triangles = number edges choose 3.

If the outcome is consistent then a is small (luck doesn't play a big role). If the outcome is showing huge variations a is big. Reasons to use this model (a) the model helps to assess outcomes (b) anticipate reversion to the mean (if luck is involved people will not win or lose consistently) (c) give good discerning feedback (in case the outcome is due to skill) (d) fair allocation of resources (skill or luck(fairness). The Paradox of Skill (Maubossin): When you have the very best competing, the differences in their skill levels may be close. So the winner will be determined by luck! Random walks. Summary: An outcome may be a series of random events and thus we should expect to see some big winners and some big losers. So we cannot expect past performance to be a good indicator of future performance. Thus key question is -- is this a random walk process -- or not? If so, expect regression to the mean. Efficient Market Hypothesis helps explain although there may be some deviations / challenges as noted in the critiques. This is like a sliding window of randomness affects the overall outcome (e.g. employees leaving and new employees getting hired; new and old products, team's of players) Strategy Colonel Blotto: A way to analyze competition, along multiple fronts trying to find advantages through strategic mismatch your opponents choices. Insight: Weaker player improves opportunities by opening more fronts (dimensions). Since this will make the stronger opponent to spread out their troops more so that the weaker opponent has the ability to win on some fronts at least. Example: differentiation in products, terrorists attack in unexpected places. ~Prisoners'\\ dilemma~ Two players who can either cooperate or defect. Collectively they are better off if both cooperate but individually, they are better off if they defect (avoiding 0 pay-off) Examples First move Second move Pay-off P1 Pay-off P2 P1 = C P2 = D 0 6 P1 = D P2 = D 2 2 Different application of PD Firms would be better of with high prices but since they are individually better off with lower (gaining more market share over the competition) prices they will end up with lower prices. 2 banks decide either not to buy ATM machines or to buy ATM machines If they don\\'t buy ATM machines Both make profits of, let\\'s say, four. if one of them buys buys ATM machines, and puts them up all over town, everyone will go to that bank. The other bank is forced to do the same. Now, both of them have probably the same customers they had to start out with, but they\\'ve spent all this money on ATM machines. So they\\'re actually worse off. In fact, it could even be worse than that. Because maybe before, part of the reason they made such profits is because they got geographic grants. People who lived around the bank shopped at that bank. Now that there\\'s ATM machines anywhere, people can shop whatever bank they want. And that\\'s created more price competition, we end up with the consumers being better off. When player 1 gets the expensive hand made match he gets all the attention. Ways to achieve cooperation Repeated Interactions (direct reciprocity), Reputation (indirect reciprocity) Networks Group Selection Influence Kin Selection Laws (prohibitions) Incentives (fines, fees, and subsidies). Collective action problems There is a cost to the individual if they take action but, yet a benefit to all if they do so. (free rider problem) Assume 10 people with cooperation payoff = 1 and defection payoff = 0 for everyone and \u00df = 0.6. If x~1~ defects his payoff is 5.4 but if cooperates his payoff is 5.0 so it is his advantage to defect to the expense of his colleagues. x~1~ takes action: 0 + .6 * 9 = 5.4 - 0 because no cost of taking action; 9 because x~1~ takes no action x~1~ takes no action: -1 + .6 * 10 = 5 - -1 = cost for x~1~ to take action; 10 = including x~1.~ Common pool resource problems Limited resource available to be used by many Mechanism design Designing incentive structures so that we get the sort of outcomes we want. Reveal hidden actions/information. Incentive compatibility = It makes sense for a worker to put in effort if the amount of money received minus the cost of effort must be greater than or equal to the probability that if they slack off, the outcome will be good anyways. Fisher's theorem More variation = faster adaptation Fisher's theorem vs. six sigma Diversity Prediction Theorem (a) more accurate individuals imply more accurate predictions (b) more diversity in crowd implies more accurate predictions. Mechanism Design An institution consists of a means through which people communicate information as well as a procedure for making decisions, reallocating resources, or producing outputs based on the information revealed. In markets, people and firms communicate through prices to execute trades and make production decisions. In hierarchies, people communicate through written language to organize work plans. And in democracies, people communicate preferences through votes. Voting rules then decide policies. Well-designed institutions induce communications and actions that produce desirable outcomes. Ineffective institutions do not. Mechanism Design highlight four aspects of institutions: information , what the participants know and should be revealed to them; incentives , the benefits and costs of taking particular actions how the individual incentives actions translate into collective outcomes ; computational costs , the cognitive demand placed on participants. Mount-Reiter diagram A mechanism consists of six parts: an environment (the relevant features of the world) set of outcomes, a set of actions (called the message space ) a behavioral rule that people follow to produce actions an outcome function that maps the actions into outcomes a social choice correspondence that maps the environment into a set of hoped-for outcomes. Within a set of outcomes, an outcome is Pareto dominated if there exists an alternative that everyone prefers. All other outcomes are Pareto efficient . For an example of Pareto efficiency, consider the following four payoff profiles for three people: {(3, 3, 4), (9, 0, 0), (0, 8, 1), (2, 2, 3)} All except (2, 2, 3) are Pareto efficient. The allocation (2, 2, 3) is dominated by (3, 3, 4).","title":"Model thinking"},{"location":"Process_System_Models/Model_thinking/#micro-motives-macro-behaviour","text":"That is: observed macrobehavior does not automatically imply biased micromotives!

The CMMI-SVC model provides guidance for applying CMMI best practices in a service provider organization. Best practices in the model focus on activities for providing quality services to customers and end users. A Capability Maturity Model \u00ae (CMM \u00ae ), including CMMI, is a simplified representation of the world. CMMs contain the essential elements of effective processes. The SEI has taken the process management premise, \"the quality of a system or product is highly influenced by the quality of the process used to develop and maintain it,\" and defined CMMs that embody this premise. The CMM Integration \u00ae project was formed to sort out the problem of using multiple CMMs. The combination of selected models into a single improvement framework was intended for use by organizations in their pursuit of enterprise-wide process improvement. Developing a set of integrated models involved more than simply combining existing model materials. Using processes that promote consensus, the CMMI Product Team built a framework that accommodates multiple constellations. The CMMI Framework provides the structure needed to produce CMMI models, training, and appraisal components. To allow the use of multiple models within the CMMI Framework, model components are classified as either common to all CMMI models or applicable to a specific model. The common material is called the \"CMMI Model Foundation\" or \"CMF.\" The components of the CMF are part of every model generated from the CMMI Framework. Those components are combined with material applicable to an area of interest (e.g., acquisition, development, services) to produce a model. A \"constellation\" is defined as a collection of CMMI components that are used to construct models, training materials, and appraisal related documents for an area of interest (e.g., acquisition, development, services). The Services constellation's model is called \"CMMI for Services\" or \"CMMI-SVC.\" CMMI-SVC draws on concepts and practices from CMMI and other service focused standards and models, including the following: Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) ISO/IEC 20000: Information Technology---Service Management Control Objectives for Information and related Technology (CobiT) Information Technology Services Capability Maturity Model (ITSCMM) The CMMI-SVC model covers the activities required to establish, deliver, and manage services. As defined in the CMMI context, a service is an intangible, non-storable product. The CMMI-SVC model has been developed to be compatible with this broad definition. The Software Engineering Institute (SEI) has found several dimensions that an organization can focus on to improve its business. Organizations typically focus on: People procedures and methods tools and equipment What holds everything together? It is the processes used in your organization. Processes allow you to align the way you do business. They allow you to address scalability and provide a way to incorporate knowledge of how to do things better. Processes allow you to leverage your resources and to examine business trends. This is not to say that people and technology are not important. We are living in a world where technology is changing at an incredible speed. Similarly, people typically work for many companies throughout their careers. We live in a dynamic world. A focus on process provides the infrastructure and stability necessary to deal with an ever-changing world and to maximize the productivity of people and the use of technology to be competitive. Problem solving Y= f(x~1~,x~2~,x~3~...x~n~) = Builds an strategic alignment Y=output/effect consists of smaller y's. Y is a function of multiple causes x=causes CCR = Critical customer requirements = translated from VOC into concrete requirements Kano Model Must be attributes are the expected attributes or \"musts\" of a product, and do not provide an opportunity for product differentiation. Increasing the performance of these attributes provides diminishing returns in terms of customer satisfaction, however the absence or poor performance of these attributes results in extreme customer dissatisfaction. Requirement that can dissatisfy, but cannot increase satisfaction. Primary Satisfiers Performance attributes are those for which more is generally better, and will improve customer satisfaction. Conversely, an absent or weak performance attribute reduces customer satisfaction. Of the needs customers verbalise, most will fall into the category of performance attributes. These attributes will form the weighted needs against which product concepts will be evaluated. The price for which customer is willing to pay for a product is closely tied to performance attributes. For example, customers would be willing to pay more for a car that provides them with better fuel economy. Delighters Excitement attributes are unspoken and unexpected by customers but can result in high levels of customer satisfaction, however their absence does not lead to dissatisfaction. Excitement attributes often satisfy latent needs real needs of which customers are currently unaware. In a competitive marketplace where manufacturer products provide similar performance, providing excitement attributes that address unknown needs can provide a competitive advantage. Although they have followed the typical evolution to a performance then a threshold attribute, cup holders were initially excitement attributes. If the requirement is absent, it does not cause dissatisfaction, but it will delight clients if present Other Attributes: Products often have attributes that cannot be classified according to the Kano Model. These attributes are often of little or no consequence to the customer, and do not factor into consumer decisions. An example of this type of attribute is a plate listing part numbers can be found under the hood on many vehicles for use by repairpersons A relatively simple approach to applying the Kano Model Analysis is to ask customers two simple questions for each attribute (Satisfied, Neutral (should be that way), Dissatisfied, does not affect my satisfaction): 1. Rate your satisfaction if the product has this attribute?; and 2. Rate your satisfaction if the product did not have this attribute? Basic attributes generally receive the \"Neutral\" response to Question 1 and the Dissatisfied response to Question 2. Exclusion of these attributes in the product has the potential to severely impact the success of the product in the marketplace. Eliminate or include performance or excitement attributes that their presence or absence respectively lead to customer dissatisfaction. This often requires a trade-off analysis against cost. As Customers frequently rate most attributes or functionality as important, asking the question How much extra would you be willing to pay for this attribute or more of this attribute? will aid in trade-off decisions, especially for performance attributes. Prioritisation matrices can be useful in determining which excitement attributes would provide the greatest returns on Customer satisfaction Examples: Must Be = Customer receives refund Primary Satisfier (more is better) = Refund received within timeframe Delighter = Receiving extra present ( discount for next purchase) CTQ = Critical to quality Use SIPOC for stakeholder analysis Look for waste in processes (mark value-added, non-value added and value-added but necessary process steps) Determine process capability Data Look at the distribution rather than only averages Narrow range of distribution and reduce variation. Reduced variation = higher process stability Look at defects rather than averages Know the CCRs At 6 Sigma the customer requirement is 6 standard deviations from the mean of the process output. If a process runs at 6 six sigma there are only 3.4 defects out of 1 million. Measure performance against process capability Process Improvement handbook In simple terms, the primary difference between a process and a procedure is that a process is what you do and a procedure is how you do it. Process Management is the ensemble of planning, engineering, improving, and monitoring an organization's processes in order to sustain organizational performance. It is a systematic approach to making an organization's workflow more effective, more efficient, and more capable of adapting to an ever-changing environment. A business process can be seen as a value chain or a set of activities that will be used to accomplish a specific organizational goal in order to meet customer requirements. Consequently, the goal of process management is to reduce human error and miscommunication in these processes and to focus stakeholders on improving their operating environment using Process Improvement methods. http://www.acuityinstitute.com/design-for-six-sigma.html DFSS Quantify the gap between as is and target for each KPI (e.g. comparison of current market share with current product on the market with intended market share with new product in target market) Weigh KPI goals according to strategic alignment Benefit estimation based on alternative project approaches by quantification of expected contribution to \"closing the gap\" Evaluate occurrence probability, i.e. probability that the respective product and/or process innovation can contribute the expected contribution to \"closing the gap\" Conduct cost estimate for each project approach by estimating the project expenses up to initial revenue receipt (alternatively: up to first positive contribution to margin or until Break Even is achieved) Service Management For all repeated services, a process is employed to carry out the service, and a set of service management processes is used to manage the service. The expectations of the customer are defined primarily by context. In evaluating service quality, measurements of customers' and stakeholders' satisfaction are the most important. Service management is the management of a service to ensure that it meets the critical outcomes the customer values and the stakeholders want to provide. The execution of a service is the process of performing the task, whereas service management is the process of making sure that the task is performed according to expectations. To optimize your outcome over time, you need to monitor customers' expectations on an ongoing basis; simply assuming that current service goals will remain static isn't good enough. The situation is dynamic, and when customers' expectations change, the service provider needs to recognize and respond to the changes. To achieve this goal, measure both performance and desired outcomes. You can measure customers' expectations by conducting customer feedback surveys and by monitoring customer responses to changes in price or other factors that affect the delivery of services. Companies use a variety of traditional surveys and Web-based monitoring tools to measure sales and customer relationship effectiveness and to keep track of performance at many levels. You must measure service activities for aspects such as cost, duration, human effort, and quality. You also need to measure progress toward the outcomes that both the customer and the stakeholders had in mind when the service was established. Process capability For discussion purposes, we will assign a customer diameter specification of 0.5 \u00b1 0.005 to the machined parts of Figure 2.3. The low specification is 0.495, and the high specification is 0.505. A 1.33 capability ratio is the minimum required by most manufacturers and can easily be determined for the process using the following arithmetic: Customer nominal = 0.5 Customer upper specification = 0.505 Customer lower specification = 0.495 Customer specification range is 0.01 total (0.505 -- 0.495) Process is centered at 0.5 Variation = 0.006 total (UCL -- LCL; 0.503 -- 0.497) Diameter Capability Ratio = Total Specification/Total Variation Diameter Capability Ratio = 0.01/0.006 Diameter Capability Ratio = 1.66 The process is stable and capable with regard to the product characteristic \"diameter.\" Original idea originates from Ford quality manual for its suppliers: The lower and upper specifications were what Ford was willing to accept, not desirable but acceptable. Over the years, the suppliers had become accustomed to consuming the entire range of specification. No process is safe from minor process average shifts due to occasional periods of instability. Ford would receive under low and over high parts when a supplier's process was consuming the entire range of specification and minor instability was experienced. Out-of-specification parts would result in rejects if found at incoming inspection and slowed production if found on the assembly line. If a supplier was consuming less than the entire specification and a minor shift in the average due to instability, there would be a better chance that under low and over high specification product would not be produced and shipped to Ford. Therefore, beginning with the publication of Ford Q101, all suppliers were required to demonstrate their capability of providing Ford with product that consumed no more than 75% of the agreed-on specification when the product average was centered at nominal. A process can be stable and yet not capable. The full range of samples selected randomly from a production run does not necessarily represent the full range of measurements that will be found if all the product were to be measured. Calculate total specification (range of variation) required to reach a capability rate of 1.33: CR =Total Specification/Total Product Variation CR (1.33 minimum) x Total Product Variation = Total Specification 1.33 x 0.04 (UCL 0.57-- LCL 0.53) = Total Specification 1.33 0.04 = 0.0532 0.0532 = Total Specification required to meet a 1.33 CR with the existing Total Product Variation. Capability\u2002Index\u2002(Cpk)\u2002versus\u2002Capability\u2002Ratio\u2002(CR) The Cpk is the same concept as the CR. The only difference is that we use Cpk when the product average is not the same as the customer nominal specification. The arithmetic for CR develops one number such as 1.33 to describe the capability of the process. The arithmetic for Cpk develops two numbers: The capability index for lower specification (CPL) describes the capability of the process in relation to the lower specification. The capability index for upper specification (CPU) describes the capability of the process in relation to the upper specification. One number, the lower number of CPL and CPU, is used to describe the capability of the process, and it is termed Cpk. The question for management now becomes how to determine the Cpk when the average is not on nominal while maintaining the industry standard minimum Cpk of 1.33. The answer is rather simple. Because the center of the normal curve will no longer be on the nominal, the distance between product average and the lower and upper specifications will no longer be equal. If the distances are not equal, we now have two numbers to describe the capability of the process. These numbers will take into account: The customer's lower specification, nominal, and upper specification The product average The amount of wall thickness variation about the product average One number will describe the distance from the low end of the product variation to the lower specification, and the other number will describe the distance from the high end of the product variation to the upper specification. These numbers are called the CPL and the CPU. Convention mandates that if either one of these two numbers is less than 1.33, we cannot call the process capable. If management decided to change the SOP and place the wall thickness average at 0.26, the arithmetic to determine the CPL and the CPU would be as follows: CPL = Product Average -- Lower Specification \u00f7 \u00bd Total Variation CPL = (0.26 -- 0.255) \u00f7 \u00bd \u00d7 (0.006) CPL = 0.005 \u00f7 0.003 CPL = 1.66 CPU = Upper Specification -- Product Average \u00f7 \u00bd Total Variation CPU = (0.285 -- 0.260) \u00f7 \u00bd \u00d7 (0.006) CPU = 0.025 \u00f7 0.003 CPU = 8.33 Generally speaking, product problems on the shop floor or at the customer or supplier fall into one of two categories. The problem can be one of instability or of incapability. Specifically, the problem exists because the product average has shifted or because the product has too much variation about a consistent average. The purpose of a process capability study is to determine if the manufacturing process is stable and capable by measuring the critical product characteristic of interest. The product measurements are then used to develop a statistical product control chart. By analyzing the data patterns on the control chart, we determine if the process is stable. If the process is stable, we then use the data to determine a Cpk value in order to determine the degree of capability. It is impossible to determine if a manufacturing process is stable if the measurement process used to measure the product is not stable. This is because an unstable measurement process will make a perfectly stable manufacturing process appear to be unstable. Unfortunately, unstable measurement processes in manufacturing are common.

The expectations of the customer are defined primarily by context. In evaluating service quality, measurements of customers' and stakeholders' satisfaction are the most important. Service management is the management of a service to ensure that it meets the critical outcomes the customer values and the stakeholders want to provide. The execution of a service is the process of performing the task, whereas service management is the process of making sure that the task is performed according to expectations. To optimize your outcome over time, you need to monitor customers' expectations on an ongoing basis; simply assuming that current service goals will remain static isn't good enough. The situation is dynamic, and when customers' expectations change, the service provider needs to recognize and respond to the changes. To achieve this goal, measure both performance and desired outcomes. You can measure customers' expectations by conducting customer feedback surveys and by monitoring customer responses to changes in price or other factors that affect the delivery of services. Companies use a variety of traditional surveys and Web-based monitoring tools to measure sales and customer relationship effectiveness and to keep track of performance at many levels. You must measure service activities for aspects such as cost, duration, human effort, and quality. You also need to measure progress toward the outcomes that both the customer and the stakeholders had in mind when the service was established.","title":"Service Management"},{"location":"Process_System_Models/Processes/#process-capability","text":"For discussion purposes, we will assign a customer diameter specification of 0.5 \u00b1 0.005 to the machined parts of Figure 2.3. The low specification is 0.495, and the high specification is 0.505. A 1.33 capability ratio is the minimum required by most manufacturers and can easily be determined for the process using the following arithmetic: Customer nominal = 0.5 Customer upper specification = 0.505 Customer lower specification = 0.495 Customer specification range is 0.01 total (0.505 -- 0.495) Process is centered at 0.5 Variation = 0.006 total (UCL -- LCL; 0.503 -- 0.497) Diameter Capability Ratio = Total Specification/Total Variation Diameter Capability Ratio = 0.01/0.006 Diameter Capability Ratio = 1.66 The process is stable and capable with regard to the product characteristic \"diameter.\" Original idea originates from Ford quality manual for its suppliers: The lower and upper specifications were what Ford was willing to accept, not desirable but acceptable. Over the years, the suppliers had become accustomed to consuming the entire range of specification. No process is safe from minor process average shifts due to occasional periods of instability. Ford would receive under low and over high parts when a supplier's process was consuming the entire range of specification and minor instability was experienced. Out-of-specification parts would result in rejects if found at incoming inspection and slowed production if found on the assembly line. If a supplier was consuming less than the entire specification and a minor shift in the average due to instability, there would be a better chance that under low and over high specification product would not be produced and shipped to Ford. Therefore, beginning with the publication of Ford Q101, all suppliers were required to demonstrate their capability of providing Ford with product that consumed no more than 75% of the agreed-on specification when the product average was centered at nominal. A process can be stable and yet not capable. The full range of samples selected randomly from a production run does not necessarily represent the full range of measurements that will be found if all the product were to be measured. Calculate total specification (range of variation) required to reach a capability rate of 1.33: CR =Total Specification/Total Product Variation CR (1.33 minimum) x Total Product Variation = Total Specification 1.33 x 0.04 (UCL 0.57-- LCL 0.53) = Total Specification 1.33 0.04 = 0.0532 0.0532 = Total Specification required to meet a 1.33 CR with the existing Total Product Variation. Capability\u2002Index\u2002(Cpk)\u2002versus\u2002Capability\u2002Ratio\u2002(CR) The Cpk is the same concept as the CR. The only difference is that we use Cpk when the product average is not the same as the customer nominal specification. The arithmetic for CR develops one number such as 1.33 to describe the capability of the process. The arithmetic for Cpk develops two numbers: The capability index for lower specification (CPL) describes the capability of the process in relation to the lower specification. The capability index for upper specification (CPU) describes the capability of the process in relation to the upper specification. One number, the lower number of CPL and CPU, is used to describe the capability of the process, and it is termed Cpk. The question for management now becomes how to determine the Cpk when the average is not on nominal while maintaining the industry standard minimum Cpk of 1.33. The answer is rather simple. Because the center of the normal curve will no longer be on the nominal, the distance between product average and the lower and upper specifications will no longer be equal. If the distances are not equal, we now have two numbers to describe the capability of the process. These numbers will take into account: The customer's lower specification, nominal, and upper specification The product average The amount of wall thickness variation about the product average One number will describe the distance from the low end of the product variation to the lower specification, and the other number will describe the distance from the high end of the product variation to the upper specification. These numbers are called the CPL and the CPU. Convention mandates that if either one of these two numbers is less than 1.33, we cannot call the process capable. If management decided to change the SOP and place the wall thickness average at 0.26, the arithmetic to determine the CPL and the CPU would be as follows: CPL = Product Average -- Lower Specification \u00f7 \u00bd Total Variation CPL = (0.26 -- 0.255) \u00f7 \u00bd \u00d7 (0.006) CPL = 0.005 \u00f7 0.003 CPL = 1.66 CPU = Upper Specification -- Product Average \u00f7 \u00bd Total Variation CPU = (0.285 -- 0.260) \u00f7 \u00bd \u00d7 (0.006) CPU = 0.025 \u00f7 0.003 CPU = 8.33 Generally speaking, product problems on the shop floor or at the customer or supplier fall into one of two categories. The problem can be one of instability or of incapability. Specifically, the problem exists because the product average has shifted or because the product has too much variation about a consistent average. The purpose of a process capability study is to determine if the manufacturing process is stable and capable by measuring the critical product characteristic of interest. The product measurements are then used to develop a statistical product control chart. By analyzing the data patterns on the control chart, we determine if the process is stable. If the process is stable, we then use the data to determine a Cpk value in order to determine the degree of capability. It is impossible to determine if a manufacturing process is stable if the measurement process used to measure the product is not stable. This is because an unstable measurement process will make a perfectly stable manufacturing process appear to be unstable. Unfortunately, unstable measurement processes in manufacturing are common.","title":"Process capability"},{"location":"Process_System_Models/Processes/#six-sigma","text":"http://lean-six-sigma.pro/Documents/Explaining%20sigma%20shift%20v2.pdf http://www.isixsigma.com/new-to-six-sigma/dmaic/scientific-problem-solving-dmaic-terms-y-fx/ A Six Sigma project is successful when the team is able to solve Y = f(x).That is, relate all the key inputs to each expected output within a small magnitude of error","title":"Six Sigma"},{"location":"Process_System_Models/Reasoning_across_the_disciplines/","text":"Thinking like a chemist Heat is preserved, it is only transferred.

Barsalou A Step-By-Step Guide to Using the Right Tool at the Right Time Root Cause Analysis: The Core of Problem Solving and Corrective Action Corrective action is the overall process involved with taking an identified problem and seeing that appropriate action is taken to resolve it. Within the corrective action process is a problem-solving process that finds and corrects the cause(s). The problem-solving process includes both a diagnostic phase and a solution phase, and it is the former that involves root cause analysis. Root-cause analysis is a process of drilling down to find causes of the problem so corrective action can be taken. By definition, corrective action means addressing causes rather than symptoms, but corrective action could be taken at the physical level only or also at the system level, depending on the criticality of the problem as well as frequency, cost, and risk. (Similar to 5-Why) Root cause analysis Key Points RCA can be performed to solve a problem or to identify improvement opportunities. Teams should be used, ideally consisting of representatives from different departments. An event or failure could have both a proximate and an ultimate root cause. Flexibility is needed in the selection of tools. Hypothesis testing Key Points A hypothesis should not make too many assumptions and should be simple and general. It must make a testable prediction to be of any use. Occam's razor is a rule of thumb that states the hypothesis with the fewest assumptions should be selected when confronted with two competing hypothesis. It is not possible to prove a hypothesis, only to support a hypothesis or reject a hypothesis. A well- corroborated hypothesis is one that has survived many attempts at refuting it. Deduction goes from the general to the specific; deductive reasoning uses what is known to form a hypothesis. It uses previous hypotheses and models to form a new hypothesis. Induction goes from the specific to the general; inductive reasoning uses observation to form a hypothesis. It uses facts and the observation of phenomena to form a hypothesis. Procedure Observe or collect the relevant data. Analyze the data and look for relationships or patterns in the data. Use the data to form a general hypothesis that goes beyond the data to make a prediction. Test the hypothesis. Use the test results as a basis for a new hypothesis if they fail to support the hypothesis. Perform confirmation testing if the results support the hypothesis. Scientific method Key Points The scientific method is empirical/ evidence based. A hypothesis is a key part of using the scientific method. Quick iterations of the iterative inductive- deductive process can lead to the root cause. The objective should not be to immediately identify a root cause but rather to move quickly through the cycles of PDCA to reject unsupported hypotheses and arrive at the root cause. Avoid holding on to a pet hypothesis once it is unequivocally disproved. Evaluating an incorrect hypothesis is not bad; defending one is. Procedure Plan: Use deductive reasoning to form a tentative hypothesis based on observation. Do: Assume the hypothesis is true for the sake of testing and evaluate it empirically, through either experimentation or observation. Check: Compare the actual results against predicted results. Act: Perform confirmation testing if the hypothesis was supported or move to the next cycle of PDCA and use induction to form a new hypothesis if the tested hypothesis was not supported. Plan: Use the knowledge gained from the previous PDCA cycle to form a new hypothesis using induction. Do: Assume the new hypothesis is true for the sake of testing and evaluate it empirically, through either experimentation or observation. Check: Compare the actual results against predicted results. Act: Perform confirmation testing if the new hypothesis was supported or move to the next cycle of PDCA and use deduction to form a hypothesis if the tested hypothesis was not supported. Repeat the iterations of the PDCA cycle until a hypothesis is sup-ported, at which time confirmation testing should be performed. Experiment Key Points A treatment, also known as an experimental run, is the set of conditions during an experiment. A factor is a condition that affects an output, for example, temperature, material type, mixture, settings on a machine, or pressure. The treatment variable, also known as an independent variable, is a factor that is manipulated by the experimenter to determine its effect or lack of effect on the response variable. A response variable, also known as the dependent variable, is the result of the manipulation of the treatment variable. The confounding variable, also known as the confounding factor, is a source of noise. Noise in an experiment is an uncontrolled and potentially unknown factor that influences the experimental results. Precision is the closeness of measurements to each other. Accuracy is the closeness of a measurement to the true value. Blocking reduces variability and increases precision by spreading confounding variables across the experimental results. (An uncontrolled variable is distributed across all treatments by ensuring all experimental groups or blocks contain the confounding variable, thereby decreasing variability and increasing the precision of the experimental results.) Randomization increases the accuracy of experimental results by canceling out the influence of noise. Replication is the repetition of an experiment to increase the accuracy and precision of the results. Operational definitions are clear quantitative descriptions of terms using tests or measurements to define the terms. Failing to check the baseline may result in attributing changes in the response variable to the setting of the treatment variable when no actual relationship exists and the response variable would have changed regardless of the setting of the treatment variable. Blind tests may be needed to increase objectivity. Procedure Create a test plan based on a hypothesis. The predicted result of the hypothesis is the response variable. Determine the treatment conditions by establishing the treatment variable or variables. Identify potential confounding variables and establish a method to eliminate, control, or minimize them. Blocking and randomization may be useful here. Ensure all terms are written as operational definitions. Establish the baseline if necessary or possible. Perform the experiment. Replicate the experiment and compare the results; a large difference is an indicator that variation is present and more replicates are needed. 8D report Key Points The 8D report provides a brief, but detailed, report on root cause analysis activities as well as the root cause. It can be used for internal or external failures. An 8D report is typically used for the investigations of failures, but the same format can be applied to improvement activities. Different companies may use different names for the eight steps; however, the steps themselves are the same. The fields on top of an 8D report should be customized to fit the needs of the company using the 8D report. Procedure Start the 8D report by filling in the fields at the top of the document and forming an interdisciplinary team. Describe the problem. Decide if containment actions are necessary. If so, assign somebody to implement them and report on the results of the containment actions. Identify the root cause of the failure by investigating the part or process that failed. The investigation should be supported by the use of quality tools. After the identification of the root cause, the corrective actions should be described. Trials should be performed to ensure that these actions will be effective. The implemented corrective actions need to be described. Actions must be taken to prevent a reoccurrence of the issue. The team needs to be congratulated, and the report should be closed.","title":"Root Cause Analysis"},{"location":"Process_System_Models/Root_Cause_Analysis/#root-cause-analysis","text":"Key Points RCA can be performed to solve a problem or to identify improvement opportunities.

When that has been clarified, one can identify: Who is involved in this problem (actors) What all these different actors want (their objectives). You can make a model (a simplified representation of reality) that describes the problem area in a simple but practical and useful way. Finally, you can show which measures (alternatives) the different actors can take. Conceptualizing is iterative in nature. Initially, this analytical process appears to be sequential. First, identify precisely what the problem is, and only then take the next step of identifying the actors involved. Although you might follow the steps successively, every step forward will lead to a revision of one or more of the previous steps. When you map out what all the actors want, you will often discover that you have not defined the problem properly. When you gather alternatives, you may notice that your model of the problem area isn't complete yet. The process of conceptualizing the problem is iterative in nature. Steps to conceptualize the problem: Problem statement The proper definition of the problem before one starts working on a project can prevent a lot of disappointment at the end. That is why you should try to spend a realistic amount of time on the formulation of the problem! 30% (or even more) of the total project time can easily be devoted to precise definition of the problem, especially with complex problems involving new technologies and/or many different actors with conflicting interests. At the basis of a problem, there are two situations: the current, or future, undesired situation, and the desired situation that a particular actor wishes to be in. The difference between the undesired and the desired situations is called 'the gap' that should be bridged by the actor. However, when trying to get from the undesired situation to the desired one, there will always be a downside to the desired situation, an effect that the actor does not like, even if his wish for the desired situation has come about. This 'unwanted downside' to the desired situation we call 'the dilemma'. The dilemma is the reason why that desired condition of the system (no noise nuisance) isn't easily accomplished. The dissatisfaction of our actor about the undesired situation is due to a certain condition of a system in which the problem occurs. Perhaps this dissatisfaction is about possible alternatives too, but they are not expressed in the problem statement. After all, in an analysis we want to keep our options open, and weigh up different alternatives. Focusing on certain alternatives already in the problem statement refrains us from doing so, so avoiding alternatives in the problem statement is essential to a thorough analysis. In looking for the dilemma in your problem, it helps when you focus on the wish of an actor (getting anywhere in the world cheaply and quickly) and how that wish is classically fulfilled (by flying, resulting in noise nuisance). Focus on what is problematic when fulfilling the actor's wish. Remember that a problem statement is always made from the perspective of a certain actor. For every actor you can design a unique problem statement, because every actor has different interests and thus will have different wishes. Nevertheless, the main elements that form the dilemma (and thus the problem) might naturally return several times in those problem statements. The art is to choose an alternative (a solution) that everybody supports with the help of an analysis that was made with all parties involved . At first it may sound strange, but you do not have to agree on what you want to accomplish (the goal) as long as you can agree on what you are going to do (the means). An increase of road taxes (alternative) on old cars can be supported by an actor because that tax increase reduces the environmental damage, as fewer old cars will be driving around. Another actor, who possibly is not interested in the environment, can support this alternative because people are then sooner inclined to discard their old car and buy a new one, eventually leading to a rise in car sales. Initial problem statements are good starting points for a discussion with your client or one of the other actors in the problem field. If you have formulated an initial theoretically correct problem statement, it is easier for them to give a short reaction, rather than an elaborate story about what they think is the problem. A useful way of presenting problem statements is to list the tensions and dilemmas different actors face. Many actors will then realize they feel the same dilemma, but only the other way around. Someone wants to reduce Co2 emissions, but fears for the country's electricity production. Someone else wants to keep the electricity production up to keep up with expected required future capacity, but fears it might come at the cost of emitting more Co2 Common mistakes when formulating problem statements: No dilemma -- every problem statement should contain both a gap (a difference between a desired condition of a system and a deferred current, or possible expected future, condition of a system) and a dilemma (a reason why that desired condition of the system isn't easily accomplished). Formulations without dilemma do not describe a problem. In other words, you know what someone wants but not why he cannot accomplish it. Because you do not know where the problem lies, you don't know what to focus on. As an analyst you will not show that you have sufficient knowledge of the system that you are analyzing, so your credibility eventually decreases. You will get less information, less co-operation, and, in the end, your analysis will fail. Problem statements without dilemmas are for example: 'We want to reduce the emission of harmful substances', 'How can we reduce the traffic jams?' or 'How can we increase our profit?' A characteristic of such formulations, without dilemmas, is that they can be solved with simple and 'strange' alternatives. In the examples named above, for example, close off the chimney, prohibit driving or rob a bank. No wish or 'gap' -- At first it is hard to see what a problem statement is without a wish. Nevertheless these statements occur frequently. They usually involve people that put the blame for a lot of things on other parties, other people, and other actors. They only mention reasons why something can't be accomplished. You could call these people 'complainers'. Because you do not know what to accomplish with such a problem statement, it is impossible to know what system to focus on, or how you can measure whether a system's condition is improving, and you do not know what kind of alternatives are actually possible. Problem statements without a wish or a 'gap' are, for example: ' i t is clear that we need a highway here, but they don't want to cooperate', 'We cannot reduce residential waste without the commitment of the citizens' or 'We would like to give the harbor a 'facelift', but the municipality won't make a budget available for us. An apparent dilemma -- 'We want to generate environmental friendly electricity without increasing C o 2 emissions', 'How can we produce more efficiently without increasing the production costs?' or 'What can we do about the traffic jams without everything getting jammed?' All these problem statements seem to have both a wish and a dilemma, but when you look closer you will actually find that there isn't a real dilemma present. Fulfilling the wish is, in these examples, the same as solving the dilemma or the other way around: if you take care of the dilemma there is no wish anymore. Both wish and dilemma focus on the same thing. In fact there is no tension at all between the wish that a client has and the reason why that wish cannot simply be fulfilled. In his urgency to make clear what the problem is, the client or the analyst has made a mistake and has introduced the same thing twice. The same difficulties arise as in the situation of a problem statement without a dilemma: you have no idea what to focus on (and when you continue your analysis, your credibility will be questioned too). Double wishes and/or dilemmas -- it is also possible that people write a problem statement that seems to be well written and complete. let's take the following problem statement: 'How can the municipality create more recreational facilities and better access to the neighborhood, without creating nuisance for the inhabitants through heavy traffic and an 'empty' neighborhood off-season?' Look at it closely: what is the wish here? Actually, there are two: creating more recreational facilities (of which we can think: is there a wish behind this? perhaps attracting more tourists?) and improving accessibility (by car or public transport, for example). Having two wishes in the problem statement means that you will have great difficulty finding alternatives. What if we remove the recreational facilities from the problem statement? Now the problem statement becomes 'How can the municipality create better access to the neighborhood, without creating nuisance for the inhabitants through heavy traffic and an 'empty' neighborhood off-season?' now, suddenly, there is no dilemma anymore! Of course, that should not be the case, since the municipality does experience a problem. I you encounter this type of problem statement, ask your client if there is a wish behind the description he gave. 'Better access to the neighborhood' can also relate to the wish of attracting more tourists (who are stuck in traffic right now, and choose other destinations because of this), so the problem statement might become: 'How can the municipality attract more tourists to the neighborhood, without creating traffic nuisance for the inhabitants?' This way, you have a clear view of the wish the municipality has, and the 'solution space' is wide open: a large number of different alternatives can be considered. Mentioning a specific alternative -- The most common mistake is not so much the problem mentioned, but the alternative that someone has thought of to solve that problem. If the problem is about capacity for electricity generation, someone will talk about the 'problem' of building power plants. If the problem is about transport capacity, people will talk about getting as many trains as possible leaving the station per hour. People find it easier to come up with an alternative, with advice, or with an idea, than to actually name the problem behind it all. A problem statement with an alternative in it causes you to think more narrowly and less creatively about possibilities to solve the problem. People will stay focused on that one alternative everyone has been talking about since the beginning of the analysis. Perhaps that alternative will eventually be implemented, but the question remains whether the right problem was solved. Examples of problem statements with alternatives named in them are; 'How can we build that nuclear plant without exceeding the budget?', 'We have to get the trucks off the motorway but we also have to maintain the flexibility of the transport system' or 'That tunnel has to be built there without damaging nature too much.' in these problem statements, one will probably not think of different alternatives than different types of power plants, reducing road freight or different forms of tunnels. This is a shame because alternatives like solar energy, reducing energy usage, other logistics, rewarding chauffeurs for desirable behaviour on the road, or reducing sound nuisance by placing sound walls could possibly be good alternatives too, depending on the real gap and dilemma of this actor Using words like 'optimal', 'minimal', best, etc. -- People generally tend to look for the solution to the problem. If they think a little longer, they might want to find the best solution. However, the problems we face are so complex, and no one can predict what the future will bring; no one can possibly predict the best alternative. Most likely, different actors will prefer different alternatives. In the end our facilitation of the decision- making process should help people to concur on a particular alternative to implement. Not necessarily for the same reason, but as long as people can agree on the alternative. Is this the best solution? Probably not, and, in addition, no one can know. Tomorrow, or in a year, the group of actors might agree on another alternative to implement. Or even today, if the group of actors are different, but the situation they face is the same, they might end up with a different alternative. Using words like 'minimal', 'best' and 'optimal' focuses on one particular alternative, the one that scores minimally on a certain criterion, or best, or optimally. Even if it were possible to agree with the group on how to translate the value of one criterion against another (so optimization would, at least mathematically, be possible), problem statements would still focus on finding one alternative. The idea is that a rational comparison of many alternatives on a set of well-balanced criteria facilitates decision-making in such a way that the actors involved can have a clear view of different alternatives and their effects, without looking for the optimal one. Actor objectives analysis, Criteria for decision making (goal tree) Actors tend to promote 'their' alternative for 'the' problem. 'Wind mills are the only serious option to tackle our energy problem, as they are really sustainable.' Usually, another actor also starts promoting his alternative, leading to lots of discussion and not bringing a shared decision for one alternative any closer. The previous Section introduced the problem statement to redirect the discussion from alternatives to the problem, mainly to keep the solution space large enough and to generate and compare several alternatives. When a list of alternatives becomes available, we would like to know to what extent they solve the problem and fit the preferences of the actors. Also, if we want to compare alternatives, we need a set of criteria with which to compare them. What is needed is a well-balanced set of criteria, representing all aspects (including the implicit ones) of our problem owner and other actors involved in the problem field. Although it will be clear from the beginning that it is difficult to take all criteria into account, it would be impossible for our client to make a well grounded and carefully considered decision if he is not aware of important criteria for all the actors involved. Remember the discussion with our problem owner about the problem statement. Especially remember the implicit dilemma he had in mind when you came up with a 'strange' solution to his problem. 'But that is not what i mean!' A clear wish and dilemma can never be represented by a single criterion. Gut, as we can guess, many more issues will be implicit in the heads of our clients. We can expect that various criteria are needed to represent all this. A structured approach to reaching these criteria is to ask 'why do you want this?' Go back to our client, our entrepreneur, who answered 'more turnover' when we asked what he wanted. We can discern several implicit thoughts behind this answer, by asking him the simple 'why?' question, over and over. 'Why do you want more turnover?' To create more profit? And why more profit? To be able to continue the business? And why continue? Your client is an entrepreneur. To ask him why he wants to continue his business (apart from being a somewhat strange question) is to discuss the 'being' of an entrepreneur: continuing the business. Hopefully there is another, more abstract goal for our client when it comes to his life: we have reached his interest, which is always there, independent of any problem, even without the problem being perceived In other words, goal trees are actor-specific. Only when all actors are involved in criteria creation (i.e., all actors have their own goal tree) can the analyst create a well-balanced set of criteria for further analysis, and which can eventually be used in the decision-making process. In practice, it is useful to start by making a goal tree with, and for, your client. Once this has been done, and your client agrees with the result, you can discuss whether it is necessary and possible to create goal trees for other actors as well. When you have a set of goal trees, you can decide on which criteria to include in your analyses. Do not be too picky about selecting criteria, since having too few criteria may lead to alternatives being selected which do not live up to the goals of the actors. What are commonly made mistakes and their effects in designing goal trees? Causal relations and/or verbs in the goal tree -- The most common error that people make in constructing goal trees is that they consider lower goals to be a means to reach higher goals. This comes close to our human habit of thinking in solutions rather than in problems, as we discussed earlier in this book. These people don't answer the question 'what is cheap energy?' They identify ways to reach cheap energy, like 'decrease production costs' or 'reduce transport costs'. These are means to reach the goal of cheap energy, not criteria to find out whether a certain alternative A results in cheaper energy than another alternative As soon as you see verbs in a goal tree, be alert. Verbs represent actions and, thus, cannot define goals. 'Increasing the number of thermal power plants' is an action, something that is done. It is done to reach a goal, like more environmentally friendly energy. It is, however, not defining what environmentally friendly energy is: it is a way to get it! In essence, all actions like these are alternatives that might (partly) solve the problem. Of course, we have to find out whether they really have potential but, in principle, they may have. Thus, when you use verbs in a goal tree you are basically introducing alternatives and, with this, creating substantial bias in your analysis. Goal tree contains alternatives -- often, people 'Operationalize' objectives like 'environmentally friendly energy' in terms of 'more photovoltaic cells' and 'more wind mills'. However, these are two alternatives that in this problem some of the actors will consider as being 'the' solution. It is alternatives like these that we want to compare, or rationalize, on a well-balanced set of criteria as input for the decision- making process. We find criteria (or better: make implicit criteria of the actors explicit) using the goal tree technique. If we introduce alternatives in the goal tree, we basically create criteria for specific alternatives. Later, in the decision-making process, these alternatives would then be compared to each other on the full set of criteria, including their 'own' criteria. As such, an alternative will always have a good score on its own criteria, while other alternatives will not, and substantial bias will have been introduced in the analysis. To put it bluntly, an alternative that involves building wind mills will never score well on 'more photovoltaic cells'. If you do not recognize alternatives immediately, for all sub-goals ask yourself the question 'does this sub-goal lead to the higher goal, or, does it define the higher goal?' Alternatives will never have definition relations with higher goals, only causal relations. Useful goal trees only obtain definition relations and no causal relations Main goal too generic -- if you keep on asking the 'why do you want this?' question, you end up with the general interest of that particular actor. Car drivers want 'good mobility'. Presidents want to stay in power; entrepreneurs want 'continuity' of their business. These interests look like goals, but it is not practical to use them as the main goal in a goal tree. These interests are always there, also no problem is perceived and, thus, no alternatives to solve it are considered. The interest turns into an objective at the moment this interest is violated: then the actor perceives a problem or a challenge and wants to solve it. At that moment it becomes practical to translate the general interest into a concrete goal for that particular perceived problem. That concrete main goal is not the same as the general interest, but represents the general interest for this particular problem. The president of an electricity producing company might consider his interest 'continuity of his company', independent of a problem. When society wants to be more environmentally friendly, and people are no longer buying his coal-generated electricity, he might translate his general interest to 'sustainable energy supply'. In his case, part of the definition of sustainable energy supply could be that there needs to be a market for His production. Should 'continuity' be the main goal, no practical well- balanced set of criteria could be found. In this case, continuity would be measured in, for instance, [year], but other too generic main goals might lead to a lot of criteria of which the majority have nothing to do with the perceived problem. Both ways, the criteria are not supporting the decision-making process. Goal tree too large -- if you do not limit yourself while making the goal tree, you may end up with a goal tree that is too large to read. It will then probably contain a very generic main goal, and a number of branches that are not at all related to the problem field. Try to use 3 to 4 levels in your goal tree, and not more than 20 goals. System description (causal diagram) A certain action will be an interesting alternative for a specific actor if it is 'doing something that solves his problem'. Now that the problems held by different actors are represented in criteria using the goal tree technique, an alternative becomes 'doing something that influences the scores on the criteria'. Basically, anything that influences the scores on the criteria can be treated as an alternative. Needless to say not all of these alternatives are practical, not even 'good' (i.e., influencing criteria in the desired direction of change). However, how 'good' certain alternatives are is a matter of interpreting their scores on the criteria. First step is to find out what influences the scores on the criteria Practically, let's take a criterion from our well-balanced set (derived from all the goal trees we made for the actors involved) and ask two questions: 'what factors influence this criterion?' and 'what factors are influenced by this criterion?' note that the questions we asked when constructing a goal tree were definition questions ('what does it mean?'), while these two questions are about causal relations ('what influences?'). Of course, many other criteria matter as well, that is why we made the effort to create all these goal trees for all actors involved to come to a well-balanced set of criteria. Your complete causal diagram, including all important criteria from the goal trees you designed, will be much larger. The causal diagram is very useful in connecting the alternatives to the criteria. Its usefulness is that is shows how (i.e., through what mechanism) the alternatives eventually change the value of the criteria. It makes it possible to estimate the effects of different alternatives on the set of criteria that is used. Therefore, it makes it possible that a client, in the end, can compare the alternatives and choose one to solve the problem. In this way, the causal diagram, like all other techniques presented in this book, helps the client decide. In other words, it facilitates the decision-making process. What can help you practically when constructing a causal diagram is to identify factors using a table with three columns: 'concepts', 'factors' and 'units'. most of the time when you start studying a system, you have some abstract ideas about things that are important. If the problem is about alternative energy sources, you quickly might think about things like 'climate', 'electricity usage', or 'environmental awareness'. These factors are not yet explicit, operational factors, but mere concepts.

When that has been clarified, one can identify: Who is involved in this problem (actors) What all these different actors want (their objectives). You can make a model (a simplified representation of reality) that describes the problem area in a simple but practical and useful way. Finally, you can show which measures (alternatives) the different actors can take. Conceptualizing is iterative in nature. Initially, this analytical process appears to be sequential. First, identify precisely what the problem is, and only then take the next step of identifying the actors involved. Although you might follow the steps successively, every step forward will lead to a revision of one or more of the previous steps. When you map out what all the actors want, you will often discover that you have not defined the problem properly. When you gather alternatives, you may notice that your model of the problem area isn't complete yet. The process of conceptualizing the problem is iterative in nature.","title":"Conceptualizing the problem"},{"location":"Process_System_Models/Solving_complex_problems/#steps-to-conceptualize-the-problem","text":"","title":"Steps to conceptualize the problem:"},{"location":"Process_System_Models/Solving_complex_problems/#problem-statement","text":"The proper definition of the problem before one starts working on a project can prevent a lot of disappointment at the end. That is why you should try to spend a realistic amount of time on the formulation of the problem! 30% (or even more) of the total project time can easily be devoted to precise definition of the problem, especially with complex problems involving new technologies and/or many different actors with conflicting interests. At the basis of a problem, there are two situations: the current, or future, undesired situation, and the desired situation that a particular actor wishes to be in. The difference between the undesired and the desired situations is called 'the gap' that should be bridged by the actor. However, when trying to get from the undesired situation to the desired one, there will always be a downside to the desired situation, an effect that the actor does not like, even if his wish for the desired situation has come about. This 'unwanted downside' to the desired situation we call 'the dilemma'. The dilemma is the reason why that desired condition of the system (no noise nuisance) isn't easily accomplished. The dissatisfaction of our actor about the undesired situation is due to a certain condition of a system in which the problem occurs. Perhaps this dissatisfaction is about possible alternatives too, but they are not expressed in the problem statement. After all, in an analysis we want to keep our options open, and weigh up different alternatives. Focusing on certain alternatives already in the problem statement refrains us from doing so, so avoiding alternatives in the problem statement is essential to a thorough analysis. In looking for the dilemma in your problem, it helps when you focus on the wish of an actor (getting anywhere in the world cheaply and quickly) and how that wish is classically fulfilled (by flying, resulting in noise nuisance). Focus on what is problematic when fulfilling the actor's wish. Remember that a problem statement is always made from the perspective of a certain actor. For every actor you can design a unique problem statement, because every actor has different interests and thus will have different wishes. Nevertheless, the main elements that form the dilemma (and thus the problem) might naturally return several times in those problem statements. The art is to choose an alternative (a solution) that everybody supports with the help of an analysis that was made with all parties involved . At first it may sound strange, but you do not have to agree on what you want to accomplish (the goal) as long as you can agree on what you are going to do (the means). An increase of road taxes (alternative) on old cars can be supported by an actor because that tax increase reduces the environmental damage, as fewer old cars will be driving around. Another actor, who possibly is not interested in the environment, can support this alternative because people are then sooner inclined to discard their old car and buy a new one, eventually leading to a rise in car sales. Initial problem statements are good starting points for a discussion with your client or one of the other actors in the problem field. If you have formulated an initial theoretically correct problem statement, it is easier for them to give a short reaction, rather than an elaborate story about what they think is the problem. A useful way of presenting problem statements is to list the tensions and dilemmas different actors face. Many actors will then realize they feel the same dilemma, but only the other way around. Someone wants to reduce Co2 emissions, but fears for the country's electricity production. Someone else wants to keep the electricity production up to keep up with expected required future capacity, but fears it might come at the cost of emitting more Co2 Common mistakes when formulating problem statements: No dilemma -- every problem statement should contain both a gap (a difference between a desired condition of a system and a deferred current, or possible expected future, condition of a system) and a dilemma (a reason why that desired condition of the system isn't easily accomplished). Formulations without dilemma do not describe a problem. In other words, you know what someone wants but not why he cannot accomplish it. Because you do not know where the problem lies, you don't know what to focus on. As an analyst you will not show that you have sufficient knowledge of the system that you are analyzing, so your credibility eventually decreases. You will get less information, less co-operation, and, in the end, your analysis will fail. Problem statements without dilemmas are for example: 'We want to reduce the emission of harmful substances', 'How can we reduce the traffic jams?' or 'How can we increase our profit?' A characteristic of such formulations, without dilemmas, is that they can be solved with simple and 'strange' alternatives. In the examples named above, for example, close off the chimney, prohibit driving or rob a bank. No wish or 'gap' -- At first it is hard to see what a problem statement is without a wish. Nevertheless these statements occur frequently. They usually involve people that put the blame for a lot of things on other parties, other people, and other actors. They only mention reasons why something can't be accomplished. You could call these people 'complainers'. Because you do not know what to accomplish with such a problem statement, it is impossible to know what system to focus on, or how you can measure whether a system's condition is improving, and you do not know what kind of alternatives are actually possible. Problem statements without a wish or a 'gap' are, for example: ' i t is clear that we need a highway here, but they don't want to cooperate', 'We cannot reduce residential waste without the commitment of the citizens' or 'We would like to give the harbor a 'facelift', but the municipality won't make a budget available for us. An apparent dilemma -- 'We want to generate environmental friendly electricity without increasing C o 2 emissions', 'How can we produce more efficiently without increasing the production costs?' or 'What can we do about the traffic jams without everything getting jammed?' All these problem statements seem to have both a wish and a dilemma, but when you look closer you will actually find that there isn't a real dilemma present. Fulfilling the wish is, in these examples, the same as solving the dilemma or the other way around: if you take care of the dilemma there is no wish anymore. Both wish and dilemma focus on the same thing. In fact there is no tension at all between the wish that a client has and the reason why that wish cannot simply be fulfilled. In his urgency to make clear what the problem is, the client or the analyst has made a mistake and has introduced the same thing twice. The same difficulties arise as in the situation of a problem statement without a dilemma: you have no idea what to focus on (and when you continue your analysis, your credibility will be questioned too). Double wishes and/or dilemmas -- it is also possible that people write a problem statement that seems to be well written and complete. let's take the following problem statement: 'How can the municipality create more recreational facilities and better access to the neighborhood, without creating nuisance for the inhabitants through heavy traffic and an 'empty' neighborhood off-season?'

Now the problem statement becomes 'How can the municipality create better access to the neighborhood, without creating nuisance for the inhabitants through heavy traffic and an 'empty' neighborhood off-season?' now, suddenly, there is no dilemma anymore! Of course, that should not be the case, since the municipality does experience a problem. I you encounter this type of problem statement, ask your client if there is a wish behind the description he gave.

However, how 'good' certain alternatives are is a matter of interpreting their scores on the criteria. First step is to find out what influences the scores on the criteria Practically, let's take a criterion from our well-balanced set (derived from all the goal trees we made for the actors involved) and ask two questions: 'what factors influence this criterion?' and 'what factors are influenced by this criterion?' note that the questions we asked when constructing a goal tree were definition questions ('what does it mean?'), while these two questions are about causal relations ('what influences?'). Of course, many other criteria matter as well, that is why we made the effort to create all these goal trees for all actors involved to come to a well-balanced set of criteria. Your complete causal diagram, including all important criteria from the goal trees you designed, will be much larger. The causal diagram is very useful in connecting the alternatives to the criteria. Its usefulness is that is shows how (i.e., through what mechanism) the alternatives eventually change the value of the criteria. It makes it possible to estimate the effects of different alternatives on the set of criteria that is used. Therefore, it makes it possible that a client, in the end, can compare the alternatives and choose one to solve the problem. In this way, the causal diagram, like all other techniques presented in this book, helps the client decide. In other words, it facilitates the decision-making process. What can help you practically when constructing a causal diagram is to identify factors using a table with three columns: 'concepts', 'factors' and 'units'. most of the time when you start studying a system, you have some abstract ideas about things that are important. If the problem is about alternative energy sources, you quickly might think about things like 'climate', 'electricity usage', or 'environmental awareness'. These factors are not yet explicit, operational factors, but mere concepts.","title":"System description (causal diagram)"},{"location":"Process_System_Models/Solving_complex_problems/#problem-diagram","text":"","title":"Problem diagram"},{"location":"Process_System_Models/Thinking_critcal_about_profound_ideas/","text":"Philosophy Pursuit of wisdom The actual word philosophy is Greek in origin, and it is the composite of two Greek roots: \"philein\", a Greek word for love, and \"Sophia\", the Greek word for wisdom. Taken together, they mean the love or pursuit of wisdom. Wisdom = ability to use and apply knowledge with great intelligence. Philosophy is committed to the truth rather than popular opinion, prevailing norms, or conventional wisdom. Aim of philosophy: Thinking critically, questioning your beliefs Open-minded: In discussions they listen carefully to every viewpoint, evaluating each perspective carefully and fairly. Knowledgeable: When they offer an opinion, it's always based on facts or evidence. On the other hand, if they lack knowledge of the subject, they acknowledge this. Mentally active: They take initiative and actively use their intelligence to confront problems and meet challenges, instead of simply responding passively to events. Curious: They explore situations with probing questions that penetrate beneath the surface of issues, instead of being satisfied with superficial explanations. Independent thinkers: They are not afraid to disagree with the group opinion. They develop well-supported beliefs through thoughtful analysis, instead of uncritically borrowing the beliefs of others or simply going along with the crowd. Skilled discussants: They are able to discuss ideas in an organized and intelligent way. Even when the issues are controversial, they listen carefully to opposing viewpoints and respond thoughtfully. Insightful: They are able to get to the heart of the issue or problem. While others may be distracted by details, they are able to zero in on the essence, seeing the forest as well the trees. Self-aware: They are aware of their own biases and are quick to point them out and take them into consideration when analyzing a situation. Creative: They can break out of established patterns of thinking and approach situations from innovative directions. Passionate: They have a passion for understanding and are always striving to see issues and problems with more clarity. The complete liberty of the mind Freedom from all social, political, or religious prejudice To care for the well-being of the soul Answer the question, \"What is it all about?\" Branches of philosophy Critical thinking process Arguments: Deductive: In a deductive argument, if the argument form is valid, and if you accept the supporting reasons (also called premises) as true, then you must necessarily accept the conclusion as true. Reason/Premise: All men are mortal. Reason/Premise: Socrates is a man. Conclusion: Therefore, Socrates is mortal. Inductive: An argument form in which one reasons from premises to a conclusion that is supported by the premises but does not follow necessarily from them. When you reason inductively, your premises provide evidence that makes it more or less probable (but not certain) that the conclusion is true. Socrates \"The unexamined life is not worth living.\" The goal of life is to know thyself and improve our souls through virtuous living. The Socratic Method Seeking clarity and truth through penetrating questioning and astute analysis Socrates left no writing of his own, so all of what we know about him comes through other sources. The richest source of his ideas comes from the Dialogues, short dramas written by Socrates student and disciple, Plato. Although Plato wrote these masterful and enduring Dialogues years after Socrates death, most experts agree that at least the initial Dialogues (Euthyphro, The Apology, Crito) are faithful portrayals of Socrates ideas. \"The truth lies within each of us.\" By living an examined life, we can discover the principles of right thinking and action within us. In our effort to improve our souls and make them more godlike, we need only to apply the divine gift of reason to look deep within ourselves and discover immutable, universal truths. Of course, this process is aided tremendously by engaging in shared explorations with others through dialectical conversations. But the ultimate answers lie within us. Socrates also extends this concept of implicit knowledge to other insights regarding the nature of reality, such as mathematics. \"We should strive for excellence in all areas of life.\" As previously mentioned, the Greeks in general and Socrates in particular believed that happiness was a con- sequence of actively exercising all of our soul s powers, and Socrates was a living example of this commitment. \"It is better to suffer wickedness than to commit it.\" Why be moral? As just noted, Socrates response is that becoming a moral person is the only way to become a truly happy, psychologically healthy person. Often adages are clich\u00e9d and empty of meaning, but for Socrates, the idea that Virtue is its own reward contains a substantial measure of truth, a point he expresses in his observation that doing wrong will harm and corrupt that part of ourselves that is improved by just actions and destroyed by unjust actions. As a thinking individual, you create yourself through the choices that you make much as a sculptor gradually forms a figure through countless cuts of the chisel. Socrates was committed to making our actions reflect our convictions. For Socrates, striving to think well-meant striving to live well, developing consistent and rigorous standards of conduct and then following through with the choices that we make. For Socrates, there was no distinction between theory and practice, thought and action in the virtuous person, they are the same. There is an intimate connection between knowledge and virtue, and as we gain intellectual understanding, we should naturally live more enlightened lives. CONSCIOUSNESS, IDENTITY, AND THE SELF Rationalism The view that reason is the primary source of all knowledge and that only our reasoning abilities can enable us to understand sense experience and reach accurate conclusions. Empiricism The view that sense experience is the primary source of all knowledge and that only a careful attention to sense experience can enable us to understand the world and achieve accurate conclusions. Materialism The philosophical view that all aspects of the universe are composed of matter and energy and can be explained by physical laws. Many philosophers and psychologists view the self from a materialistic point of view, contending that in the final analysis mental states are identical with, reducible to, or explainable in terms of physical brain states. Mark Twain: \"How come the mind gets drunk when the body does the drinking?\" Socrates The soul is immortal For Socrates, reality is dualistic, comprised of two dichotomous realms. One realm is changeable, transient, and imperfect, whereas the other realm is unchanging, eternal, and immortal. The physical world in which we live comprising all that we can see, hear, taste, smell, and feel belongs to the former realm. All aspects of our physical world are continually changing, transforming, disappearing. In contrast, the unchanging, eternal, perfect realm includes the intellectual essences of the universe, concepts such as truth, goodness, and beauty. We find examples of these ideal forms in the physical world for example, we might describe someone as truthful, good, or beautiful. But these examples are always imperfect and limited: It is only the ideal forms themselves that are perfect, unchanging, and eternal. What is truly remarkable about these ideas is how closely they parallel modern Western consciousness. A finite body; an immortal soul; a perfect, eternal realm with which the soul seeks communion and eternal bliss: All of the basic elements of Western (and some Eastern) religions are present. Plato Three-part soul/ Reason: Our divine essence that enables us to think deeply, make wise choices, and achieve a true understanding of eternal truths. Physical Appetite : Our basic biological needs such as hunger, thirst, and sexual desire. Spirit or Passion: Our basic emotions such as love, anger, ambition, aggressive- ness, empathy. Plato believed that genuine happiness can only be achieved by people who consistently make sure that their Reason is in control of their Spirits and Appetites (critique: overemphasizing the power and authority of reason, and underemphasizing the importance of the body and emotions). Plato illustrates his view of the soul/self in Phaedrus with a vivid metaphor: The soul is likened to a chariot drawn by two powerful winged horses a noble horse, representing Spirit, and a wild horse, embodying Appetite. The charioteer is Reason, whose task is to guide the chariot to the eternal realm by controlling the two independent- minded horses. Those charioteers who are successful in setting a true course and ensuring that the two steeds work together in harmonious unity achieve true wisdom and banquet with the gods. However, those charioteers who are unable to control their horses and keep their chariot on track are destined to experience personal, intellectual, and spiritual failure. Buddhism Milindapanha, The Simile of the Chariot (http://www.usna.edu/Users/history/abels/hh205/milinda.html) For Buddhists, every aspect of life is impermanent, and all elements of the universe are in a continual process of change and transition, a process that includes each self as well. The self can best be thought of as a flame that is continually passed from candle to candle, retaining a certain continuity but no real personal identity a concept very different from the self of Western consciousness. According to Buddhist philosophy, the self is composed of five aggregates: physical form sensation conceptualization dispositions to act consciousness Each self is comprised of the continual interplay of these five elements, but there is no substance or identity beyond the dynamic interaction of these five elements. Descartes Cogito, ergo sum = I think, therefore I am. Descartes confesses that he has come to the conclusion that virtually everything he has been taught from authorities and other adults is questionable and likely false. His radical solution? To establish a fresh start on gaining true, well-supported beliefs by simply erasing his endorsement of anything he has previously been taught. Cogito, ergo sum is the first principle of Descartes theory of knowledge because he is confident that no rational person will doubt his or her own existence as a conscious, thinking entity while we are aware of thinking about our self. Even if we are dreaming or hallucinating, even if our consciousness is being manipulated by some external entity, it is still my self-aware self that is dreaming, hallucinating, or being manipulated. If your self-identity is dependent on the fact that you are capable of being aware you are engaging in these mental operations while you are engaged in them. If you were consistently not conscious of your mental operations, consistently unaware of your thinking, reasoning, and perceiving processes, then it would not be possible for you to have a self-identity, a unique essence, a you. Locke To discover the nature of personal identity, we're going to have to find out what it means to be a person. A person is a thinking, intelligent being who has the abilities to reason and to reflect. A person is also someone who considers itself to be the same thing in different times and different places. Consciousness being aware that we are thinking always accompanies thinking and is an essential part of the thinking process. Consciousness is what makes possible our belief that we are the same identity in different times and different places. Kant Our minds actively sort, organize, relate, and synthesize the fragmented, fluctuating collection of sense data that our sense organs take in. For example, imagine that someone dumped a pile of puzzle pieces on the table in front of you. They would initially appear to be a random collection of items, unrelated to one another and containing no meaning for you, much like the basic sensations of immediate unreflective experience. However, as you began to assemble the pieces, these fragmentary items would gradually begin to form a coherent image that would have significance for you. According to Kant this meaning-constructing activity is precisely what our minds are doing all of the time: taking the raw data of experience and actively synthesizing it into the familiar, orderly, meaningful world in which we live. As you might imagine, this mental process is astonishing in its power and complexity, and it is going on all of the time. Unity of consciousness . Thoughts and perceptions of any given mind are bound together in a unity by being all contained in your consciousness. This picture is uniquely your picture. Your self is able to perform this synthesizing, unifying function because it transcends sense experience. How do our minds know the best way to construct an intelligible world out of a never-ending avalanche of sensations? We each have fundamental organizing rules or principles built into the architecture of our minds. These dynamic principles naturally order, categorize, organize, and synthesize sense data into the familiar fabric of our lives, bounded by space and time. These organizing rules are a priori in the sense that they precede the sensations of experience and they exist independently of these sensations. We didn't have to learn these a priori ways of organizing and relating the world they came as software already installed in our intellectual operating systems. FREEDOM AND DETERMINISM External vs. internal forces If you are limited by external forces , the way to free yourself is to neutralize or remove them, so that you can make choices that reflect your genuine desires. For example, if your choices are constrained by an unreasonable boss, you have to either change that person s coercive behavior or remove yourself from the situation to achieve genuine freedom. If you believe that your choices are excessively limited by the geographical location in which you live, you might have to move in order to increase your possibilities. Existentialism, A philosophical movement that emphasizes the challenge and responsibility of all people to create a meaningful existence through the free choices they make. In seeking meaning, existentialists believe that we cannot look outward to a supernatural creator or an intelligible universe: We must look inward, to our own resources and possibilities, as we struggle to create meaning in a world that often seems chaotic and absurd. Determinism The view that every event, including human actions, is brought about by previous events in accordance with universal causal laws that govern the world. Human freedom is an illusion. Indeterminism The view that some events, including human actions, are not necessarily determined by previous events in accordance with universal causal laws. Libertarianism The view that humans are able to make authentically free choices that are not determined by previous events in accordance with universal causal laws, that there is a meaningful sense that though we made one choice, we could have done otherwise. Compatibilism The view that all events, including human actions, are caused. However, we can consider human actions free if they are the result of internal motivations, not the product of external influences or constraints. How can we know the nature of reality? Metaphysics -- What is real? Most generally, the philosophical investigation of the nature, constitution, and structure of reality. Epistemology -- What is true? The study of the nature of knowledge and justification. Plato: As we saw, Plato s metaphysical belief in the world of Being and the eternal Forms is tied to: Kant: Sensations would be nothing to us, and would not concern us in the least, if they were not received into our (orderly) consciousness. Knowledge is impossible in any other way. . . . For perceptions could not be perceptions of anything for me unless they . . . could at least be connected together into (my) one conscious- ness. This principle stands firm a priori, and may be called \"the transcendental principle of unity\" for all the multiplicity of our perceptions and sensations. The entire reality, which we assume to be completely independent of ourselves, is in fact, as Kant maintained, constituted by the active structuring of our minds. Categories or schemata (such as time, space, cause and effect) are universally present in normally functioning humans, we all share a common universe, constituted and defined by the same basic qualities and relations. Universal concepts: Unity, plurality, and totality for concept of quantity; reality, negation, and limitation, for the concept of quality; inherence and subsistence, cause and effect, and community for the concept of relation; possibility-impossibility, existence-nonexistence, and necessity and contingency for the concept of modality. Emotions Emotions vs. feelings: The point is that what we perceive in the world and our judgments about these perceptions influence our emotional reactions. And conversely, our emotions have a dramatic influence on what we perceive and how we interpret it. And because our knowledge of the world begins with perceptions, values and emotions are a natural and inseparable part of this knowing process. Physiological feelings may accompany emotions, they are clearly not the same phenomenon. As Jaggar notes, feelings are episodic in the sense that they occur at a given moment in time, whereas emotions extend over time: For instance, we may assert truthfully that we are outraged by, proud of or saddened by certain events, even if at the moment we are neither agitated nor tearful. In addition, although people may be unaware of their emotional state angry, ambivalent, depressed they are (nearly) always aware of what they are feeling at any given moment in time. If emotions include but also transcend episodic feelings, what else are they? One perspective the cognitivist point of view sees emotions as involving intentional judgments as well as physiological sensations. So, for example, you may be feeling anxious or agitated but is the emotion involved related to concern about an upcoming exam or concern about an upcoming romantic date? In other words, an important component in emotions is the intentional judgment that is associated with the physiological feeling. We may conclude, for instance, that it is our (intentional) evaluation of an upcoming date that is responsible for the anxiety ( butterflies ) we are feeling. Yet as important as intentional judgments are for understanding the nature of emotions, we still have not fully accounted for the complex nature of emotional experience. In addition to immediate feelings and intentional judgments, emotions are also constituted by the social context in which they occur. For example, individuals in each culture are taught the appropriate emotional responses to people (strangers, authorities, religious figures, romantic interests) as well as situations (competitive sports, academic achievement, perceived insults). Each culture has its own unique emotional vocabulary that members of the culture learn at an early age, and this emotional vocabulary is an essential component in what emotions are all about. This vocabulary is expressed in the concepts and language of the culture, as well as in the actions and attitudes of the members. Jaggar s example of the emotion romantic love is pertinent here. Although there is general agreement regarding what this emotional concept means, each culture also tends to define the emotion and its affiliated attitudes and behavior in ways that are distinctive to that culture. The net result is that these social influences are integral elements in the construction of human emotions: hence the notion of emotions as social constructs. Is there a spiritual reality - Religion A means to achieve ultimate spiritual transformation. And such a spiritual quest necessarily involves what we think, feel, and do. The way we live our lives becomes a vehicle for achieving ultimate spiritual transformation, and our religion provides us with the ethical roadmap. Second, religion provides a metaphysical grounding for morality. If a person or people develop an ethical system and instruct us to abide by its principles, we can legitimately ask, why should I follow your principles? What gives you special legitimacy over any other person to determine ethical guidelines? However, if an ethical system is grounded in a supernatural creator or what is thought to be a fundamental principle of the universe, then the ethical system speaks with a special authority. Why should I follow these principles? Because God (or some other metaphysical authority) endorses these principles. That removes moral values from the level of human-to-human debate and raises it to a spiritual level. A Brief Survey of World Religions Hinduism Hinduism is the term used to designate the complex mosaic of religious beliefs and practices of the vast majority of the people of India. One of the oldest living religions in the world No single founder but evolved over a period of four thousand years, its history interwoven with religious and cultural movements. Hindu -> Sanskrit word sindu for river (Hindu referring to the Indus River) Alternative term for Hinduism preferred today is Sanatana Dharma. Sanatana -> eternal religion Dharma embodies a holistic approach to both personal spiritual fulfillment and social harmony. Many manifestations of single God assuming different forms. Vedas -> Ancient scriptures revered by Hindus. 4 parts Upanishads -> The philosophical part of the Vedas, intended only for serious seekers. The Upanishads are thought to have developed between 600 and 400 B.C.E., about the same time that Gautama Buddha (c. 563 483 B.C.E.), the founder of Buddhism, lived on the Indian subcontinent. Five main themes: Contemplation of the luminous self. Spiritual enlightenment can be achieved only by turning one's attention inward to discover a transcendent reality from within. The bodily senses are made for looking outward and are easily enticed by sensory pleasures and worldly spectacles. But these sensations are fleeting and impermanent, passing away when one dies, and obscure the search for the infinite, everlasting reality. This unseen but all-pervading reality they called Brahman, the Unknowable. From Brahman originate the multiplicity of all forms, including humans, and thus Brahman can be discovered in the soul (atman) within ourselves. Reincarnation. The belief that the soul leaves the dead body and enters a new one, being born over and over in countless bodies. Whether the body is that of an animal or other life form, the self remains constant. But rebirth as a human being is a precious and rare opportunity for the soul to advance toward its ultimate goal of liberation from rebirth and merging with the Brahman. Karma . Progress toward a merging with Brahman is the result of karma, which refers to one's actions as well as the consequences of one's actions. The ultimate goal of creating ourselves through good choices is to escape from the karmic wheel of birth, death, and rebirth, which is called samsara. To escape from samsara is to achieve liberation from the limitations of space, time, and matter through realization of the immortal absolute. Yogic practices . Disciplines that clear the mind and support a state of serene, detached awareness. This desired state of balance, purity, and peacefulness of mind is described as sattvic, in contrast with active, restless states or lethargic dull states. The practices for increasing sattvic qualities are known collectively as yoga, from the Sanskrit word for union (in this case the union of body, mind, and spirit). Fire sacrifices Buddhism http://www.usna.edu/Users/history/abels/hh205/milinda.html Nontheist religion that does not believe in a super- natural God or Creator . Instead, the ultimate transformation to which Buddhists aspire is to escape the world of suffering through our own efforts until we finally achieve Nirvana (the ultimate egoless state of bliss). originator of Buddhism -> Siddhartha Gautama 4 noble truths of suffering: Life inevitably involves suffering, is imperfect and unsatisfactory . Suffering and frustration is an unavoidable part of living- Happiness is fleeting, with unhappiness its constant shadow. Even the self is an impermanent illusion. The I is really a perpetually transient bundle of fleeting sensations, impressions, ideas, and feelings. The metaphor often used for the Buddhist concept of the self is that of a flame being passed from candle to candle in continual movement. Suffering originates in our desires . Desires are wishes for things to be different than they are. We wish for good health, riches and fame, eternal life, perpetual happiness, permanence and security, and many other things as well. But none of these wishes can be achieved in a permanent fashion because life and the universe are essentially impermanent. And because our wishes are continually thwarted and events in the world are beyond our control, frustration and suffering are unavoidable. Suffering will cease if all desires cease . This can be achieved only by realizing and accepting the fact that there is no unique, separate, permanent, immortal self. Once we understand that our self is simply an impermanent flow of energy tied to the larger energies of the cosmos, we are freed to realize that desires and suffering are irrelevant. In practical terms, accepting the non- existence of a permanent self encourages us to live happily and fully in the moment, liberated from self-centeredness and full of compassion for others. There is a way to realize this state: the Noble Eightfold Path. Extinguishing desire and suffering is a process that can be achieved by following the guidelines embodied in the Noble Eightfold Path, devoted to pursuing morality, focus, and wisdom. The Noble Eightfold Path is a systematic philosophy of life that enables people gradually to free themselves from desire and suffering and achieve the ultimate peace of Nirvana. This process typically extends over multiple lifetimes, as we are caught in the perpetual cycle of death and rebirth. Once again, the self is not a permanent, immortal entity but is akin to a flame being passed from moment to moment, lifetime to lifetime. The Noble Eightfold Path includes right understanding, right thought and motives, right mindfulness, and right mediation. Daoism/Taoism At the time that India was giving birth to Hinduism and Buddhism, East Asia saw the creation of Daoism and Confucianism (in China) and Shinto (in Japan). Daoism, on the other hand, is a way of life inspired from the rhythms of natural phenomena. Daoism promotes a constant interaction with our environment and the importance of being aware of it. Dao is believed to be the first cause of the universe. It is the unnamable and eternally real force that flows through life, and each believer s goal is to become one with the Dao. Although Dao can be translated as path or the way, it is basically indefinable. Reality cannot be named or known through language, logic, or concepts it must be experienced. Dao refers to a power that envelops and flows through all things, living and nonliving. The Dao regulates natural processes and balances the universe. Daoists do not pray to a Supreme Being; instead, they seek answers to life s problems through inner meditation and observation. For the Daoist, time is cyclical, not linear as in Western thinking. The entire cosmos is a manifestation of an impersonal self-generating energy called qi (ch i). This force has two aspects whose interplay causes the ever-changing phenomena of the universe. Yin is the dark, receptive, female aspect; Yang is the bright, assertive, male aspect. The Yin is considered to be the breath that formed Earth, whereas the Yang is the breath that formed the heavens. These two forces symbolize the pairs of opposites that are seen throughout the universe, such as good and evil, light and dark, male and female. Wisdom lies in recognizing the ever-shifting, but regular and balanced, patterns of movement of Yin and Yang and moving along with them. The Dao is this creative rhythm of the universe. Daoists follow the art of wu-wei, which is to let nature take its course, rather than trying to impede it. To take a metaphor from the natural world, one should allow a river to flow toward the sea unimpeded, instead of erecting a dam that would interfere with its natural flow. Analogously, we should be like flowing water ourselves, bypassing and gently wearing away obstacles rather than aggressively attacking them, effortlessly moving through life without struggling, leaving all accomplishment behind without trying to hold on to them. Even when difficulties arise, the Daoist does not panic and take unnecessary action. This is a philosophy that Daoists believe should be practiced on a social and political level as well. Judaism Judaism traces its roots to about 3,800 years ago, when, according to the holy scriptures known col- lectively as the TaNaKh, God entered into a covenant with Abraham. According to the covenant, Abraham and his descendants would give God (Yah- weh) their exclusive devotion and obedience, and God would choose them to enjoy special consideration and protection (thus the idea that Jews are God' s chosen people ). Jewish scripture also states that God promised Canaan (now Israel) to the Jews as their homeland. First and foremost is monotheism, a belief in one Creator God, all-pow- erful, all-loving, and ever-present. In stories from scripture, this God demands obe- dience, metes out rewards and punishments, and issues a moral code (the Ten Commandments). Religious holidays and rituals are based on key events in Jewish history as recorded in Jewish scriptures. These events serve as moral paradigms, symbolically rich stories that have continued relevance to contemporary lives. Divinely inspired laws that cover every aspect of Jewish social, communal, and religious life are another core element of Jewish religious faith. These laws have been codified in the Torah, a word which has a variety of meanings. One meaning refers to the first five books of the TaNaKh, believed to be the word of God as told to Moses. These teachings have evolved over time through the ongoing study and writings of Jew- ish scholars. Christianity Christianity emerged and split off from Judaism some 1,800 years after Abraham. At its core is the belief that Jesus is the son of God and savior whose sacrificial death and resurrection make it possible for souls to have eternal life in heaven. Chris- tian scriptures consist of the Hebrew TaNaKh, which Chris- tians refer to as the Old Testament, and the writings of Jesus s followers, known as the New Testament. Christianity is the largest of the world s religions, with approximately 2.1 billion adherents. The New Testament contains the teachings of Jesus, a Jew who lived in Palestine under Roman rule at the beginning of the first millennium C.E. Jesus describes God as a loving Father who will take care of those who love Him and want to follow the path of righteousness. Jesus message was to reveal this path, through words and actions, so that all could achieve spiritual perfection and salvation in preparation for life after death. He makes clear that each person s relationship with God is intensely personal, nurtured through worship, reflection, and personal prayer. Jesus preached a radical ethic, focusing his attention on the most disinherited people of the day, including the poor, the outcasts, the prostitutes, and even the most despised people of the day, the Roman tax collectors. What s more, Jesus preached that, in the next life, the favored individuals would include the poor in spirit, the meek, the mourners, the seekers of righteousness, the pure in heart, the merciful, the peacemakers, and those who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness and for spreading the gospel. In addition to complete devotion to God, the core of Jesus message was a love and devotion to others. In fact, Jesus preached that in extending ourselves to the less fortunate in society, we are symbolically worshiping God. Islam The world s second largest religion, Islam, views itself as the ultimate expression of the monotheistic tradition that began when God spoke to Abraham. Muslims believe that Muhammad, who lived in the Arabian pennisula from 570 to 632 C.E., is the last and final prophet to receive the word of Allah (Allah is the Arabic word for God). Jesus is also viewed as a prophet, but Muslims believe that his message was corrupted by followers who insisted on his divinity. According to Islam, God revealed his messages to Muhammad through the angel Gabriel over the course of twenty- three years. These revelations constitute the text of the Qur an, the unchanged, untranslated word of God. The Five Pillars spell out the way of Muslim life and its purposes: The First Pillar is shahadah, the profession of faith . There is no God but Allah, and Muhammad is his Prophet. This is the foundation stone of Islam, incorporating both a monotheistic belief in God and the recognition that while Muhammad is not divine, he is the last and greatest prophet of God. Although Islam believes that there might be many names for God, it is a religion built on the firm conviction that there is only one God, and it is our responsibility to submit totally to God s will in every dimension of our lives. The Second Pillar of Islam is salat, the performance of a continual round of prayers , a response to the natural yearning of the human heart to pour forth its love and gratitude toward its Creator. Regular prayer also keeps a Muslim s life in proper perspective, a reminder to submit to God s will as rightfully sovereign over his or her life. A Muslim should pray five times daily on rising, at noon, in midafternoon, after sunset, and before retiring. The Third Pillar is zakat, the yearly setting aside of a portion of one's wealth for the benefit of others. There are always those who possess more material things than others, and Islam tries to bring a balance to this situation by asking those who have much to help lift the burden of those who have less. In addition to the zakat, Muslims are encouraged to give alms to charities. The Fourth Pillar is sawm, the observance of Ramadan , the holy month in the Arabian calendar. This was the period in which Muhammad received his initial commission as a prophet and ten years later made his historic flight from Mecca to Medina. To commemorate these two occasions, those who are physically able to fast during the entire month. From dawn to sunset, Muslims do not eat, drink, have sexual intercourse, or smoke. Fasting underscores humankind s depen- dence on God and, by experiencing what it is like to feel hunger and suffering, helps make us more compassionate. The Fifth Pillar is hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca where one performs a set of rites. Once in a lifetime a Muslim is expected, if physical and economic conditions per- mit, to make this journey to Mecca where God s ultimate revelation was first dis- closed. Here again, similar to fasting during Ramadan, the purpose is to heighten the pilgrim s devotion to God and to His revealed will. \"Leap of faith\" Soren Kierkegaard Then how do we achieve a confidence in God s existence? Kierkegaard says we must let go of our efforts to prove God s existence with logical, rational means and instead simply let the reality of his existence become manifest. But this act of letting go is difficult: We naturally strive for objective certainty, demonstrable proof that will satisfy the demands of reason. To let go of this compulsion requires an act of will, a leap of faith in God s reality. And when we truly let go of our rational efforts, our faith is rewarded by our experiencing the reality of God s existence in nonrational or supra- rational ways. We can again see the analogy with nurturing a loving relationship: We need to let go of our need to analyze every dimension of the relationship for the authentic emotions to be released and suffuse our shared experiences. ETHICS The study of ethics is derived from the ancient Greek word ethos, which refers to moral purpose or character as in a person of upstanding character. Ethos is also associated with the idea of cultural customs or habits. In addition, the etymology of the word moral can be traced back to the Latin word moralis, which also means custom. Thus the origins of these key concepts reflect both the private and the public nature of the moral life: We strive to become morally enlightened people, but we do so within the social context of cultural customs. In philosophy, one of the most important value domains includes your moral values, those personal qualities and rules of conduct that distinguish a person (and group of people) of upstanding character. But most people in our culture today have not been exposed to these teachings in depth. They have not challenged themselves to think deeply about ethical concepts, nor have they been guided to develop coherent, well- grounded ethical systems of their own. In many cases people attempt to navigate their passage through the turbulent and treacherous waters of contemporary life without an accurate moral compass, relying instead on a tangled m\u00e9lange of childhood teachings, popular wisdom, and unreliable intuitions. These homegrown and unreflective ethical systems are simply not up to the task of sorting out the moral complexities in our bewildering and fast-paced world, contributing to the moral crisis. Which of your moral values are clearly articulated and well-grounded? Which are ill-defined and tenuously rooted? Do your values form a coherent whole, consistent with one another, or do you detect fragmentation and inconsistency? The fatal flaw of ethical subjectivism is that it does not entail tolerance for the views or interests of others. It simply invests each individual with the moral authority to determine what is morally right and wrong, even if this means violating the rights or interests of others. Gandhi: The golden rule of conduct, therefore, is mutual tolerance, seeing that we will never all think alike and we shall see Truth in fragments and from different angles of vision. Conscience is not the same thing for all. Whilst there, it is a good guide for individual conduct, imposition of that conduct upon all will be an insufferable interference with everybody s freedom of conscience. The popular statement \"Everyone is entitled to his or her own belief \" suggests that no individual person has the right to say to another, \"Your belief is wrong you should believe this instead.\" In fact, it's often considered bad manners to question the beliefs of others and to suggest that their beliefs are confused, unfounded, illogical, or outright wrong. This approach seems to be tolerant and democratic, and it often works well for matters of taste. It doesn't make sense for you to say to someone else, You are wrong to wear your hair in a mullet, sport a tattoo, and eat chunky peanut butter directly from the jar. You might reasonably say, That's not my style, or I prefer a different look, but not that a person with different tastes is wrong. But moral beliefs are very, very different. If someone says, I agree with Hitler there is only one super-race, and all others are inferior, it does make sense to disagree and say, I think your belief is unethical and wrong. On what rationale do you base it? Similarly, if someone says, I think that the sexual abuse of children is all right, that person is not simply stating a personal belief: The individual is enunciating a general moral value that he or she believes applies to everyone. That s the unique logic of moral beliefs: When I say that something is right or wrong, I am by definition suggesting that it is right or wrong not just for me but for everyone. Moral beliefs implicate and influence our relationships with others in a way that matters of taste never will. Because moral beliefs affect the treatment and well-being of others, they are held to a much higher standard of evaluation and justification than other types The point is that our moral beliefs, whether openly acknowledged or implicit, have real-world consequences. Ethical egoism Ayn Rand The virtue of altruism that traditional ethical theories and religions recommend is actually a vice because it encourages people not to pursue their own self-interest as their top priority. Again ethical egoism Confusion 1: It is false to believe that selfishness means the same thing as self-interest. Confusion 2: It is false to say that every action is done either from self-interest or from other-regarding motives. Confusion 3: It is false to assume that a concern for one's own welfare is incompatible with any genuine concern for the welfare of others. Do the gods love piety because it is pious, or is it pious because they love it? In other words, is a moral value good or right because God commands it to be so, or is the moral value good or right independently of God s commands (though it is presumably consistent with divine moral values)? Character: Virtue Ethics For Aristotle and other believers in virtue ethics, it is the cultivation of a virtuous character that is the goal of ethics, to become a virtuous person. The assumption is that genuinely virtuous people will act in morally principled ways as a natural expression of their moral goodness. And these moral actions will in turn strengthen their virtuous nature. Aristotle points out that, though we desire pleasure, wealth, fame, and success, we desire them mainly because we hope that they will bring us happiness. Similarly, people often strive to achieve virtues such as honor and intellectual insight, though again the ultimate aim is to be happy. Doctrine of the Golden Mean, a moral philosophy that is based on the concepts of temperance (moderation), self-discipline, and balance (an approach analogous to the Middle Way practiced in Buddhism). Virtue then is a state of deliberate moral purpose consisting in a mean that is relative to ourselves, the mean being determined by reason, or as a prudent man would determine it. Existentialism For existentialism the questions are more along the lines of: How do I live my life authentically? How can I create myself to be a uniquely significant individual? How can I invest my life with meaning while existing in a universe that lacks ultimate meaning? How can I develop an approach to moral responsibility that is grounded in my absolute freedom of choice? Once you have developed a clear understanding of your moral code, the struggle has just begun. Becoming a morally enlightened person a person of character and integrity requires not just an insightful moral compass but also the commitment to use the compass to navigate the way through the storms and shoals of your moral life. As a reflective critical thinker, you will be conscious of the choices you are making and the reasons you are making them, and you will learn from experience, refining your code of ethics and improving your moral choices through self-exploration. Achieving moral enlightenment is an ongoing process, but it is a struggle that cannot be avoided if you are to live a life of purpose and meaning, created by a self that is authentic and, as Aristotle would say, great-souled.","title":"Thinking critcal about profound ideas"},{"location":"Process_System_Models/Thinking_critcal_about_profound_ideas/#philosophy","text":"Pursuit of wisdom The actual word philosophy is Greek in origin, and it is the composite of two Greek roots: \"philein\", a Greek word for love, and \"Sophia\", the Greek word for wisdom. Taken together, they mean the love or pursuit of wisdom. Wisdom = ability to use and apply knowledge with great intelligence. Philosophy is committed to the truth rather than popular opinion, prevailing norms, or conventional wisdom. Aim of philosophy: Thinking critically, questioning your beliefs Open-minded: In discussions they listen carefully to every viewpoint, evaluating each perspective carefully and fairly. Knowledgeable: When they offer an opinion, it's always based on facts or evidence. On the other hand, if they lack knowledge of the subject, they acknowledge this. Mentally active: They take initiative and actively use their intelligence to confront problems and meet challenges, instead of simply responding passively to events. Curious: They explore situations with probing questions that penetrate beneath the surface of issues, instead of being satisfied with superficial explanations. Independent thinkers: They are not afraid to disagree with the group opinion. They develop well-supported beliefs through thoughtful analysis, instead of uncritically borrowing the beliefs of others or simply going along with the crowd. Skilled discussants: They are able to discuss ideas in an organized and intelligent way. Even when the issues are controversial, they listen carefully to opposing viewpoints and respond thoughtfully. Insightful: They are able to get to the heart of the issue or problem. While others may be distracted by details, they are able to zero in on the essence, seeing the forest as well the trees. Self-aware: They are aware of their own biases and are quick to point them out and take them into consideration when analyzing a situation. Creative: They can break out of established patterns of thinking and approach situations from innovative directions.

The Socratic Method Seeking clarity and truth through penetrating questioning and astute analysis Socrates left no writing of his own, so all of what we know about him comes through other sources. The richest source of his ideas comes from the Dialogues, short dramas written by Socrates student and disciple, Plato. Although Plato wrote these masterful and enduring Dialogues years after Socrates death, most experts agree that at least the initial Dialogues (Euthyphro, The Apology, Crito) are faithful portrayals of Socrates ideas. \"The truth lies within each of us.\" By living an examined life, we can discover the principles of right thinking and action within us. In our effort to improve our souls and make them more godlike, we need only to apply the divine gift of reason to look deep within ourselves and discover immutable, universal truths. Of course, this process is aided tremendously by engaging in shared explorations with others through dialectical conversations. But the ultimate answers lie within us. Socrates also extends this concept of implicit knowledge to other insights regarding the nature of reality, such as mathematics. \"We should strive for excellence in all areas of life.\" As previously mentioned, the Greeks in general and Socrates in particular believed that happiness was a con- sequence of actively exercising all of our soul s powers, and Socrates was a living example of this commitment. \"It is better to suffer wickedness than to commit it.\" Why be moral? As just noted, Socrates response is that becoming a moral person is the only way to become a truly happy, psychologically healthy person. Often adages are clich\u00e9d and empty of meaning, but for Socrates, the idea that Virtue is its own reward contains a substantial measure of truth, a point he expresses in his observation that doing wrong will harm and corrupt that part of ourselves that is improved by just actions and destroyed by unjust actions. As a thinking individual, you create yourself through the choices that you make much as a sculptor gradually forms a figure through countless cuts of the chisel. Socrates was committed to making our actions reflect our convictions. For Socrates, striving to think well-meant striving to live well, developing consistent and rigorous standards of conduct and then following through with the choices that we make. For Socrates, there was no distinction between theory and practice, thought and action in the virtuous person, they are the same. There is an intimate connection between knowledge and virtue, and as we gain intellectual understanding, we should naturally live more enlightened lives.","title":"Socrates"},{"location":"Process_System_Models/Thinking_critcal_about_profound_ideas/#consciousness-identity-and-the-self","text":"","title":"CONSCIOUSNESS, IDENTITY, AND THE SELF"},{"location":"Process_System_Models/Thinking_critcal_about_profound_ideas/#rationalism","text":"The view that reason is the primary source of all knowledge and that only our reasoning abilities can enable us to understand sense experience and reach accurate conclusions.","title":"Rationalism"},{"location":"Process_System_Models/Thinking_critcal_about_profound_ideas/#empiricism","text":"The view that sense experience is the primary source of all knowledge and that only a careful attention to sense experience can enable us to understand the world and achieve accurate conclusions.","title":"Empiricism"},{"location":"Process_System_Models/Thinking_critcal_about_profound_ideas/#materialism","text":"The philosophical view that all aspects of the universe are composed of matter and energy and can be explained by physical laws.

And conversely, our emotions have a dramatic influence on what we perceive and how we interpret it. And because our knowledge of the world begins with perceptions, values and emotions are a natural and inseparable part of this knowing process. Physiological feelings may accompany emotions, they are clearly not the same phenomenon. As Jaggar notes, feelings are episodic in the sense that they occur at a given moment in time, whereas emotions extend over time: For instance, we may assert truthfully that we are outraged by, proud of or saddened by certain events, even if at the moment we are neither agitated nor tearful. In addition, although people may be unaware of their emotional state angry, ambivalent, depressed they are (nearly) always aware of what they are feeling at any given moment in time. If emotions include but also transcend episodic feelings, what else are they? One perspective the cognitivist point of view sees emotions as involving intentional judgments as well as physiological sensations. So, for example, you may be feeling anxious or agitated but is the emotion involved related to concern about an upcoming exam or concern about an upcoming romantic date? In other words, an important component in emotions is the intentional judgment that is associated with the physiological feeling. We may conclude, for instance, that it is our (intentional) evaluation of an upcoming date that is responsible for the anxiety ( butterflies ) we are feeling. Yet as important as intentional judgments are for understanding the nature of emotions, we still have not fully accounted for the complex nature of emotional experience. In addition to immediate feelings and intentional judgments, emotions are also constituted by the social context in which they occur. For example, individuals in each culture are taught the appropriate emotional responses to people (strangers, authorities, religious figures, romantic interests) as well as situations (competitive sports, academic achievement, perceived insults). Each culture has its own unique emotional vocabulary that members of the culture learn at an early age, and this emotional vocabulary is an essential component in what emotions are all about. This vocabulary is expressed in the concepts and language of the culture, as well as in the actions and attitudes of the members. Jaggar s example of the emotion romantic love is pertinent here. Although there is general agreement regarding what this emotional concept means, each culture also tends to define the emotion and its affiliated attitudes and behavior in ways that are distinctive to that culture. The net result is that these social influences are integral elements in the construction of human emotions: hence the notion of emotions as social constructs.","title":"Emotions"},{"location":"Process_System_Models/Thinking_critcal_about_profound_ideas/#is-there-a-spiritual-reality-religion","text":"A means to achieve ultimate spiritual transformation.

Five main themes: Contemplation of the luminous self. Spiritual enlightenment can be achieved only by turning one's attention inward to discover a transcendent reality from within. The bodily senses are made for looking outward and are easily enticed by sensory pleasures and worldly spectacles. But these sensations are fleeting and impermanent, passing away when one dies, and obscure the search for the infinite, everlasting reality. This unseen but all-pervading reality they called Brahman, the Unknowable. From Brahman originate the multiplicity of all forms, including humans, and thus Brahman can be discovered in the soul (atman) within ourselves. Reincarnation. The belief that the soul leaves the dead body and enters a new one, being born over and over in countless bodies. Whether the body is that of an animal or other life form, the self remains constant. But rebirth as a human being is a precious and rare opportunity for the soul to advance toward its ultimate goal of liberation from rebirth and merging with the Brahman. Karma . Progress toward a merging with Brahman is the result of karma, which refers to one's actions as well as the consequences of one's actions. The ultimate goal of creating ourselves through good choices is to escape from the karmic wheel of birth, death, and rebirth, which is called samsara. To escape from samsara is to achieve liberation from the limitations of space, time, and matter through realization of the immortal absolute. Yogic practices .

Instead, the ultimate transformation to which Buddhists aspire is to escape the world of suffering through our own efforts until we finally achieve Nirvana (the ultimate egoless state of bliss). originator of Buddhism -> Siddhartha Gautama 4 noble truths of suffering: Life inevitably involves suffering, is imperfect and unsatisfactory . Suffering and frustration is an unavoidable part of living- Happiness is fleeting, with unhappiness its constant shadow. Even the self is an impermanent illusion. The I is really a perpetually transient bundle of fleeting sensations, impressions, ideas, and feelings. The metaphor often used for the Buddhist concept of the self is that of a flame being passed from candle to candle in continual movement. Suffering originates in our desires . Desires are wishes for things to be different than they are. We wish for good health, riches and fame, eternal life, perpetual happiness, permanence and security, and many other things as well. But none of these wishes can be achieved in a permanent fashion because life and the universe are essentially impermanent. And because our wishes are continually thwarted and events in the world are beyond our control, frustration and suffering are unavoidable. Suffering will cease if all desires cease . This can be achieved only by realizing and accepting the fact that there is no unique, separate, permanent, immortal self. Once we understand that our self is simply an impermanent flow of energy tied to the larger energies of the cosmos, we are freed to realize that desires and suffering are irrelevant. In practical terms, accepting the non- existence of a permanent self encourages us to live happily and fully in the moment, liberated from self-centeredness and full of compassion for others. There is a way to realize this state: the Noble Eightfold Path. Extinguishing desire and suffering is a process that can be achieved by following the guidelines embodied in the Noble Eightfold Path, devoted to pursuing morality, focus, and wisdom. The Noble Eightfold Path is a systematic philosophy of life that enables people gradually to free themselves from desire and suffering and achieve the ultimate peace of Nirvana. This process typically extends over multiple lifetimes, as we are caught in the perpetual cycle of death and rebirth. Once again, the self is not a permanent, immortal entity but is akin to a flame being passed from moment to moment, lifetime to lifetime. The Noble Eightfold Path includes right understanding, right thought and motives, right mindfulness, and right mediation.","title":"Buddhism"},{"location":"Process_System_Models/Thinking_critcal_about_profound_ideas/#daoismtaoism","text":"At the time that India was giving birth to Hinduism and Buddhism, East Asia saw the creation of Daoism and Confucianism (in China) and Shinto (in Japan). Daoism, on the other hand, is a way of life inspired from the rhythms of natural phenomena. Daoism promotes a constant interaction with our environment and the importance of being aware of it. Dao is believed to be the first cause of the universe. It is the unnamable and eternally real force that flows through life, and each believer s goal is to become one with the Dao. Although Dao can be translated as path or the way, it is basically indefinable. Reality cannot be named or known through language, logic, or concepts it must be experienced. Dao refers to a power that envelops and flows through all things, living and nonliving. The Dao regulates natural processes and balances the universe. Daoists do not pray to a Supreme Being; instead, they seek answers to life s problems through inner meditation and observation. For the Daoist, time is cyclical, not linear as in Western thinking. The entire cosmos is a manifestation of an impersonal self-generating energy called qi (ch i). This force has two aspects whose interplay causes the ever-changing phenomena of the universe. Yin is the dark, receptive, female aspect; Yang is the bright, assertive, male aspect. The Yin is considered to be the breath that formed Earth, whereas the Yang is the breath that formed the heavens. These two forces symbolize the pairs of opposites that are seen throughout the universe, such as good and evil, light and dark, male and female. Wisdom lies in recognizing the ever-shifting, but regular and balanced, patterns of movement of Yin and Yang and moving along with them. The Dao is this creative rhythm of the universe. Daoists follow the art of wu-wei, which is to let nature take its course, rather than trying to impede it. To take a metaphor from the natural world, one should allow a river to flow toward the sea unimpeded, instead of erecting a dam that would interfere with its natural flow. Analogously, we should be like flowing water ourselves, bypassing and gently wearing away obstacles rather than aggressively attacking them, effortlessly moving through life without struggling, leaving all accomplishment behind without trying to hold on to them. Even when difficulties arise, the Daoist does not panic and take unnecessary action. This is a philosophy that Daoists believe should be practiced on a social and political level as well.","title":"Daoism/Taoism"},{"location":"Process_System_Models/Thinking_critcal_about_profound_ideas/#judaism","text":"Judaism traces its roots to about 3,800 years ago, when, according to the holy scriptures known col- lectively as the TaNaKh, God entered into a covenant with Abraham. According to the covenant, Abraham and his descendants would give God (Yah- weh) their exclusive devotion and obedience, and God would choose them to enjoy special consideration and protection (thus the idea that Jews are God' s chosen people ). Jewish scripture also states that God promised Canaan (now Israel) to the Jews as their homeland. First and foremost is monotheism, a belief in one Creator God, all-pow- erful, all-loving, and ever-present. In stories from scripture, this God demands obe- dience, metes out rewards and punishments, and issues a moral code (the Ten Commandments). Religious holidays and rituals are based on key events in Jewish history as recorded in Jewish scriptures. These events serve as moral paradigms, symbolically rich stories that have continued relevance to contemporary lives. Divinely inspired laws that cover every aspect of Jewish social, communal, and religious life are another core element of Jewish religious faith. These laws have been codified in the Torah, a word which has a variety of meanings. One meaning refers to the first five books of the TaNaKh, believed to be the word of God as told to Moses. These teachings have evolved over time through the ongoing study and writings of Jew- ish scholars.","title":"Judaism"},{"location":"Process_System_Models/Thinking_critcal_about_profound_ideas/#christianity","text":"Christianity emerged and split off from Judaism some 1,800 years after Abraham. At its core is the belief that Jesus is the son of God and savior whose sacrificial death and resurrection make it possible for souls to have eternal life in heaven. Chris- tian scriptures consist of the Hebrew TaNaKh, which Chris- tians refer to as the Old Testament, and the writings of Jesus s followers, known as the New Testament. Christianity is the largest of the world s religions, with approximately 2.1 billion adherents. The New Testament contains the teachings of Jesus, a Jew who lived in Palestine under Roman rule at the beginning of the first millennium C.E. Jesus describes God as a loving Father who will take care of those who love Him and want to follow the path of righteousness. Jesus message was to reveal this path, through words and actions, so that all could achieve spiritual perfection and salvation in preparation for life after death. He makes clear that each person s relationship with God is intensely personal, nurtured through worship, reflection, and personal prayer. Jesus preached a radical ethic, focusing his attention on the most disinherited people of the day, including the poor, the outcasts, the prostitutes, and even the most despised people of the day, the Roman tax collectors. What s more, Jesus preached that, in the next life, the favored individuals would include the poor in spirit, the meek, the mourners, the seekers of righteousness, the pure in heart, the merciful, the peacemakers, and those who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness and for spreading the gospel. In addition to complete devotion to God, the core of Jesus message was a love and devotion to others. In fact, Jesus preached that in extending ourselves to the less fortunate in society, we are symbolically worshiping God.","title":"Christianity"},{"location":"Process_System_Models/Thinking_critcal_about_profound_ideas/#islam","text":"The world s second largest religion, Islam, views itself as the ultimate expression of the monotheistic tradition that began when God spoke to Abraham. Muslims believe that Muhammad, who lived in the Arabian pennisula from 570 to 632 C.E., is the last and final prophet to receive the word of Allah (Allah is the Arabic word for God). Jesus is also viewed as a prophet, but Muslims believe that his message was corrupted by followers who insisted on his divinity. According to Islam, God revealed his messages to Muhammad through the angel Gabriel over the course of twenty- three years. These revelations constitute the text of the Qur an, the unchanged, untranslated word of God. The Five Pillars spell out the way of Muslim life and its purposes: The First Pillar is shahadah, the profession of faith . There is no God but Allah, and Muhammad is his Prophet. This is the foundation stone of Islam, incorporating both a monotheistic belief in God and the recognition that while Muhammad is not divine, he is the last and greatest prophet of God. Although Islam believes that there might be many names for God, it is a religion built on the firm conviction that there is only one God, and it is our responsibility to submit totally to God s will in every dimension of our lives. The Second Pillar of Islam is salat, the performance of a continual round of prayers , a response to the natural yearning of the human heart to pour forth its love and gratitude toward its Creator. Regular prayer also keeps a Muslim s life in proper perspective, a reminder to submit to God s will as rightfully sovereign over his or her life. A Muslim should pray five times daily on rising, at noon, in midafternoon, after sunset, and before retiring. The Third Pillar is zakat, the yearly setting aside of a portion of one's wealth for the benefit of others. There are always those who possess more material things than others, and Islam tries to bring a balance to this situation by asking those who have much to help lift the burden of those who have less. In addition to the zakat, Muslims are encouraged to give alms to charities. The Fourth Pillar is sawm, the observance of Ramadan , the holy month in the Arabian calendar. This was the period in which Muhammad received his initial commission as a prophet and ten years later made his historic flight from Mecca to Medina. To commemorate these two occasions, those who are physically able to fast during the entire month. From dawn to sunset, Muslims do not eat, drink, have sexual intercourse, or smoke. Fasting underscores humankind s depen- dence on God and, by experiencing what it is like to feel hunger and suffering, helps make us more compassionate. The Fifth Pillar is hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca where one performs a set of rites. Once in a lifetime a Muslim is expected, if physical and economic conditions per- mit, to make this journey to Mecca where God s ultimate revelation was first dis- closed. Here again, similar to fasting during Ramadan, the purpose is to heighten the pilgrim s devotion to God and to His revealed will.","title":"Islam"},{"location":"Process_System_Models/Thinking_critcal_about_profound_ideas/#leap-of-faith-soren-kierkegaard","text":"Then how do we achieve a confidence in God s existence? Kierkegaard says we must let go of our efforts to prove God s existence with logical, rational means and instead simply let the reality of his existence become manifest. But this act of letting go is difficult: We naturally strive for objective certainty, demonstrable proof that will satisfy the demands of reason. To let go of this compulsion requires an act of will, a leap of faith in God s reality. And when we truly let go of our rational efforts, our faith is rewarded by our experiencing the reality of God s existence in nonrational or supra- rational ways. We can again see the analogy with nurturing a loving relationship: We need to let go of our need to analyze every dimension of the relationship for the authentic emotions to be released and suffuse our shared experiences.","title":"\"Leap of faith\" Soren Kierkegaard"},{"location":"Process_System_Models/Thinking_critcal_about_profound_ideas/#ethics","text":"The study of ethics is derived from the ancient Greek word ethos, which refers to moral purpose or character as in a person of upstanding character. Ethos is also associated with the idea of cultural customs or habits. In addition, the etymology of the word moral can be traced back to the Latin word moralis, which also means custom. Thus the origins of these key concepts reflect both the private and the public nature of the moral life: We strive to become morally enlightened people, but we do so within the social context of cultural customs. In philosophy, one of the most important value domains includes your moral values, those personal qualities and rules of conduct that distinguish a person (and group of people) of upstanding character. But most people in our culture today have not been exposed to these teachings in depth. They have not challenged themselves to think deeply about ethical concepts, nor have they been guided to develop coherent, well- grounded ethical systems of their own. In many cases people attempt to navigate their passage through the turbulent and treacherous waters of contemporary life without an accurate moral compass, relying instead on a tangled m\u00e9lange of childhood teachings, popular wisdom, and unreliable intuitions. These homegrown and unreflective ethical systems are simply not up to the task of sorting out the moral complexities in our bewildering and fast-paced world, contributing to the moral crisis. Which of your moral values are clearly articulated and well-grounded? Which are ill-defined and tenuously rooted? Do your values form a coherent whole, consistent with one another, or do you detect fragmentation and inconsistency? The fatal flaw of ethical subjectivism is that it does not entail tolerance for the views or interests of others. It simply invests each individual with the moral authority to determine what is morally right and wrong, even if this means violating the rights or interests of others. Gandhi: The golden rule of conduct, therefore, is mutual tolerance, seeing that we will never all think alike and we shall see Truth in fragments and from different angles of vision. Conscience is not the same thing for all. Whilst there, it is a good guide for individual conduct, imposition of that conduct upon all will be an insufferable interference with everybody s freedom of conscience. The popular statement \"Everyone is entitled to his or her own belief \" suggests that no individual person has the right to say to another, \"Your belief is wrong you should believe this instead.\" In fact, it's often considered bad manners to question the beliefs of others and to suggest that their beliefs are confused, unfounded, illogical, or outright wrong. This approach seems to be tolerant and democratic, and it often works well for matters of taste. It doesn't make sense for you to say to someone else, You are wrong to wear your hair in a mullet, sport a tattoo, and eat chunky peanut butter directly from the jar. You might reasonably say, That's not my style, or I prefer a different look, but not that a person with different tastes is wrong. But moral beliefs are very, very different. If someone says, I agree with Hitler there is only one super-race, and all others are inferior, it does make sense to disagree and say, I think your belief is unethical and wrong. On what rationale do you base it? Similarly, if someone says, I think that the sexual abuse of children is all right, that person is not simply stating a personal belief: The individual is enunciating a general moral value that he or she believes applies to everyone. That s the unique logic of moral beliefs: When I say that something is right or wrong, I am by definition suggesting that it is right or wrong not just for me but for everyone. Moral beliefs implicate and influence our relationships with others in a way that matters of taste never will. Because moral beliefs affect the treatment and well-being of others, they are held to a much higher standard of evaluation and justification than other types The point is that our moral beliefs, whether openly acknowledged or implicit, have real-world consequences.","title":"ETHICS"},{"location":"Process_System_Models/Thinking_critcal_about_profound_ideas/#ethical-egoism","text":"Ayn Rand The virtue of altruism that traditional ethical theories and religions recommend is actually a vice because it encourages people not to pursue their own self-interest as their top priority.

Confusion 2: It is false to say that every action is done either from self-interest or from other-regarding motives. Confusion 3: It is false to assume that a concern for one's own welfare is incompatible with any genuine concern for the welfare of others. Do the gods love piety because it is pious, or is it pious because they love it? In other words, is a moral value good or right because God commands it to be so, or is the moral value good or right independently of God s commands (though it is presumably consistent with divine moral values)?","title":"Ethical egoism"},{"location":"Process_System_Models/Thinking_critcal_about_profound_ideas/#character-virtue-ethics","text":"For Aristotle and other believers in virtue ethics, it is the cultivation of a virtuous character that is the goal of ethics, to become a virtuous person. The assumption is that genuinely virtuous people will act in morally principled ways as a natural expression of their moral goodness. And these moral actions will in turn strengthen their virtuous nature. Aristotle points out that, though we desire pleasure, wealth, fame, and success, we desire them mainly because we hope that they will bring us happiness. Similarly, people often strive to achieve virtues such as honor and intellectual insight, though again the ultimate aim is to be happy. Doctrine of the Golden Mean, a moral philosophy that is based on the concepts of temperance (moderation), self-discipline, and balance (an approach analogous to the Middle Way practiced in Buddhism).

Becoming a morally enlightened person a person of character and integrity requires not just an insightful moral compass but also the commitment to use the compass to navigate the way through the storms and shoals of your moral life. As a reflective critical thinker, you will be conscious of the choices you are making and the reasons you are making them, and you will learn from experience, refining your code of ethics and improving your moral choices through self-exploration. Achieving moral enlightenment is an ongoing process, but it is a struggle that cannot be avoided if you are to live a life of purpose and meaning, created by a self that is authentic and, as Aristotle would say, great-souled.","title":"Existentialism"}]}
