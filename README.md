This is my knowledge base based on [mkdocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) it actually lives [here](https://dbremen.github.io/DirksWiki/). This is to facility taking my notes in word (docx) files and uploading them into searchable KB.

- And runs mkdoc to convert the .md files to .html
