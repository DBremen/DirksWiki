## Key Points {#key-points}

*   A treatment, also known as an experimental run, is the set of conditions during an experiment.
*   A factor is a condition that affects an output, for example, temperature, material type, mixture, settings on a machine, or pressure.
*   The treatment variable, also known as an independent variable, is a factor that is manipulated by the experimenter to determine its effect or lack of effect on the response variable.
*   A response variable, also known as the dependent variable, is the result of the manipulation of the treatment variable.
*   The confounding variable, also known as the confounding factor, is a source of noise.
*   Noise in an experiment is an uncontrolled and potentially unknown factor that influences the experimental results.
*   Precision is the closeness of measurements to each other.
*   Accuracy is the closeness of a measurement to the true value.
*   Blocking reduces variability and increases precision by spreading confounding variables across the experimental results. (An uncontrolled variable is distributed across all treatments by ensuring all experimental groups or blocks contain the confounding variable, thereby decreasing variability and increasing the precision of the experimental results.)
*   Randomization increases the accuracy of experimental results by canceling out the influence of noise.
*   Replication is the repetition of an experiment to increase the accuracy and precision of the results.
*   Operational definitions are clear quantitative descriptions of terms using tests or measurements to define the terms.
*   Failing to check the baseline may result in attributing changes in the response variable to the setting of the treatment variable when no actual relationship exists and the response variable would have changed regardless of the setting of the treatment variable.
*   Blind tests may be needed to increase objectivity.
