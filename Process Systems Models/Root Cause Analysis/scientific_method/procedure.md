## Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Plan: Use deductive reasoning to form a tentative hypothesis based on observation.
2.  Do: Assume the hypothesis is true for the sake of testing and evaluate it empirically, through either experimentation or observation.
3.  Check: Compare the actual results against predicted results.
4.  Act: Perform confirmation testing if the hypothesis was supported or move to the next cycle of PDCA and use induction to form a new hypothesis if the tested hypothesis was not supported.
5.  Plan: Use the knowledge gained from the previous PDCA cycle to form a new hypothesis using induction.
6.  Do: Assume the new hypothesis is true for the sake of testing and evaluate it empirically, through either experimentation or observation.
7.  Check: Compare the actual results against predicted results.
8.  Act: Perform confirmation testing if the new hypothesis was supported or move to the next cycle of PDCA and use deduction to form a hypothesis if the tested hypothesis was not supported.
9.  Repeat the iterations of the PDCA cycle until a hypothesis is sup-ported, at which time confirmation testing should be performed.
