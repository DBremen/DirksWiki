Root Cause Analysis: The Core of Problem Solving and Corrective Action

Corrective action is the overall process involved with taking an identified problem and seeing that appropriate action is taken to resolve it. Within the corrective action process is a problem-solving process that finds and corrects the cause(s). The problem-solving process includes both a diagnostic phase and a solution phase, and it is the former that involves root cause analysis. Root-cause analysis is a process of drilling down to find causes of the problem so corrective action can be taken. By definition, corrective action means addressing causes rather than symptoms, but corrective action could be taken at the physical level only or also at the system level, depending on the criticality of the problem as well as frequency, cost, and risk.
