## Key Points {#key-points}

*   A hypothesis should not make too many assumptions and should be simple and general. It must make a testable prediction to be of any use.
*   Occamâ€™s razor is a rule of thumb that states the hypothesis with the fewest assumptions should be selected when confronted with two competing hypothesis.
*   It is not possible to prove a hypothesis, only to support a hypothesis or reject a hypothesis. A well- corroborated hypothesis is one that has survived many attempts at refuting it.
*   Deduction goes from the general to the specific; deductive reasoning uses what is known to form a hypothesis. It uses previous hypotheses and models to form a new hypothesis.
*   Induction goes from the specific to the general; inductive reasoning uses observation to form a hypothesis. It uses facts and the observation of phenomena to form a hypothesis.
