# ETHICS {#ethics}

The study of ethics is derived from the ancient Greek word ethos, which refers to moral purpose or character as in a person of upstanding character. Ethos is also associated with the idea of cultural customs or habits. In addition, the etymology of the word moral can be traced back to the Latin word moralis, which also means custom. Thus the origins of these key concepts reflect both the private and the public nature of the moral life: We strive to become morally enlightened people, but we do so within the social context of cultural customs.

In philosophy, one of the most important value domains includes your moral values, those personal qualities and rules of conduct that distinguish a person (and group of people) of upstanding character.

But most people in our culture today have not been exposed to these teachings in depth. They have not challenged themselves to think deeply about ethical concepts, nor have they been guided to develop coherent, well- grounded ethical systems of their own. In many cases people attempt to navigate their passage through the turbulent and treacherous waters of contemporary life without an accurate moral compass, relying instead on a tangled mélange of childhood teachings, popular wisdom, and unreliable intuitions. These homegrown and unreflective ethical systems are simply not up to the task of sorting out the moral complexities in our bewildering and fast-paced world, contributing to the moral crisis.

Which of your moral values are clearly articulated and well-grounded?

Which are ill-defined and tenuously rooted?

Do your values form a coherent whole, consistent with one another, or do you detect fragmentation and inconsistency?

The fatal flaw of **ethical subjectivism** is that it does not entail tolerance for the views or interests of others. It simply invests each individual with the moral authority to determine what is morally right and wrong, even if this means violating the rights or interests of others.

Gandhi:

The golden rule of conduct, therefore, is mutual tolerance, seeing that we will never all think alike and we shall see Truth in fragments and from different angles of vision. Conscience is not the same thing for all. Whilst there, it is a good guide for individual conduct, imposition of that conduct upon all will be an insufferable interference with everybody s freedom of conscience.

The popular statement “Everyone is entitled to his or her own belief “ suggests that no individual person has the right to say to another, “Your belief is wrong you should believe this instead.” In fact, it’s often considered bad manners to question the beliefs of others and to suggest that their beliefs are confused, unfounded, illogical, or outright wrong. This approach seems to be tolerant and democratic, and it often works well for matters of taste. It doesn’t make sense for you to say to someone else, You are wrong to wear your hair in a mullet, sport a tattoo, and eat chunky peanut butter directly from the jar. You might reasonably say, That’s not my style, or I prefer a different look, but not that a person with different tastes is wrong.

But moral beliefs are very, very different. If someone says, I agree with Hitler there is only one super-race, and all others are inferior, it does make sense to disagree and say, I think your belief is unethical and wrong. On what rationale do you base it? Similarly, if someone says, I think that the sexual abuse of children is all right, that person is not simply stating a personal belief: The individual is enunciating a general moral value that he or she believes applies to everyone. That s the unique logic of moral beliefs: When I say that something is right or wrong, I am by definition suggesting that it is right or wrong not just for me but for everyone.

Moral beliefs implicate and influence our relationships with others in a way that matters of taste never will. Because moral beliefs affect the treatment and well-being of others, they are held to a much higher standard of evaluation and justification than other types **The point is that our moral beliefs, whether openly acknowledged or implicit, have real-world consequences.**
