**“The unexamined life is not worth living.”**

The goal of life is to know thyself and improve our souls through virtuous living.

The Socratic Method Seeking clarity and truth through penetrating questioning and astute analysis

Socrates left no writing of his own, so all of what we know about him comes through other sources. The richest source of his ideas comes from the Dialogues, short dramas written by Socrates student and disciple, Plato. Although Plato wrote these masterful and enduring Dialogues years after Socrates death, most experts agree that at least the initial Dialogues (Euthyphro, The Apology, Crito) are faithful portrayals of Socrates ideas.

**“The truth lies within each of us.”** By living an examined life, we can discover the principles of right thinking and action within us. In our effort to improve our souls and make them more godlike, we need only to apply the divine gift of reason to look deep within ourselves and discover immutable, universal truths. Of course, this process is aided tremendously by engaging in shared explorations with others through dialectical conversations. But the ultimate answers lie within us. Socrates also extends this concept of implicit knowledge to other insights regarding the nature of reality, such as mathematics.

**“We should strive for excellence in all areas of life.”** As previously mentioned, the Greeks in general and Socrates in particular believed that happiness was a con- sequence of actively exercising all of our soul s powers, and Socrates was a living example of this commitment.

**“It is better to suffer wickedness than to commit it.”** Why be moral? As just noted, Socrates response is that becoming a moral person is the only way to become a truly happy, psychologically healthy person. Often adages are clichéd and empty of meaning, but for Socrates, the idea that Virtue is its own reward contains a substantial measure of truth, a point he expresses in his observation that doing wrong will harm and corrupt that part of ourselves that is improved by just actions and destroyed by unjust actions. As a thinking individual, you create yourself through the choices that you make much as a sculptor gradually forms a figure through countless cuts of the chisel.

Socrates was committed to making our actions reflect our convictions. **For Socrates, striving to think well-meant striving to live well, developing consistent and rigorous standards of conduct and then following through with the choices that we make. For Socrates, there was no distinction between theory and practice, thought and action in the virtuous person, they are the same.** There is an intimate connection between knowledge and virtue, and as we gain intellectual understanding, we should naturally live more enlightened lives.
