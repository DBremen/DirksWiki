## “Leap of faith” Soren Kierkegaard {#leap-of-faith-soren-kierkegaard}

Then how do we achieve a confidence in God s existence? Kierkegaard says we must let go of our efforts to prove God s existence with logical, rational means and instead simply let the reality of his existence become manifest. But this act of letting go is difficult: We naturally strive for objective certainty, demonstrable proof that will satisfy the demands of reason. To let go of this compulsion requires an act of will, a leap of faith in God s reality. And when we truly let go of our rational efforts, our faith is rewarded by our experiencing the reality of God s existence in nonrational or supra- rational ways. We can again see the analogy with nurturing a loving relationship: We need to let go of our need to analyze every dimension of the relationship for the authentic emotions to be released and suffuse our shared experiences.
