*   A means to achieve ultimate spiritual transformation. And such a spiritual quest necessarily involves what we think, feel, and do. The way we live our lives becomes a vehicle for achieving ultimate spiritual transformation, and our religion provides us with the ethical roadmap.
*   Second, religion provides a metaphysical grounding for morality. If a person or people develop an ethical system and instruct us to abide by its principles, we can legitimately ask, why should I follow your principles? What gives you special legitimacy over any other person to determine ethical guidelines? However, if an ethical system is grounded in a supernatural creator or what is thought to be a fundamental principle of the universe, then the ethical system speaks with a special authority. Why should I follow these principles? Because God (or some other metaphysical authority) endorses these principles. That removes moral values from the level of human-to-human debate and raises it to a spiritual level.
