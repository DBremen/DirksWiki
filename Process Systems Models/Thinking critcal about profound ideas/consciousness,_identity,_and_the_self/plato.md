## Plato {#plato}

Three-part soul/

1.  **Reason:** Our divine essence that enables us to think deeply, make wise choices, and achieve a true understanding of eternal truths.
2.  **Physical Appetite**: Our basic biological needs such as hunger, thirst, and sexual desire.
3.  **Spirit or Passion:** Our basic emotions such as love, anger, ambition, aggressive- ness, empathy.

Plato believed that genuine happiness can only be achieved by people who consistently make sure that their Reason is in control of their Spirits and Appetites (critique: overemphasizing the power and authority of reason, and underemphasizing the importance of the body and emotions). Plato illustrates his view of the soul/self in Phaedrus with a vivid metaphor: The soul is likened to a chariot drawn by two powerful winged horses a noble horse, representing Spirit, and a wild horse, embodying Appetite. The charioteer is Reason, whose task is to guide the chariot to the eternal realm by controlling the two independent- minded horses. Those charioteers who are successful in setting a true course and ensuring that the two steeds work together in harmonious unity achieve true wisdom and banquet with the gods. However, those charioteers who are unable to control their horses and keep their chariot on track are destined to experience personal, intellectual, and spiritual failure.
