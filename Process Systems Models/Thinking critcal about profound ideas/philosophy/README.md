*   Pursuit of wisdom

The actual word philosophy is Greek in origin, and it is the composite of two Greek roots: “philein”, a Greek word for love, and “Sophia”, the Greek word for wisdom. Taken together, they mean the love or pursuit of wisdom. Wisdom = ability to use and apply knowledge with great intelligence.

Philosophy is committed to the truth rather than popular opinion, prevailing norms, or conventional wisdom.

Aim of philosophy:

*   Thinking critically, questioning your beliefs
    *   **Open-minded:** In discussions they listen carefully to every viewpoint, evaluating each perspective carefully and fairly.
    *   **Knowledgeable:** When they offer an opinion, it’s always based on facts or evidence. On the other hand, if they lack knowledge of the subject, they acknowledge this.
    *   **Mentally active:** They take initiative and actively use their intelligence to confront problems and meet challenges, instead of simply responding passively to events.
    *   **Curious:** They explore situations with probing questions that penetrate beneath the surface of issues, instead of being satisfied with superficial explanations.
    *   **Independent thinkers:** They are not afraid to disagree with the group opinion. They develop well-supported beliefs through thoughtful analysis, instead of uncritically borrowing the beliefs of others or simply going along with the crowd.
    *   **Skilled discussants:** They are able to discuss ideas in an organized and intelligent way. Even when the issues are controversial, they listen carefully to opposing viewpoints and respond thoughtfully.
    *   **Insightful:** They are able to get to the heart of the issue or problem. While others may be distracted by details, they are able to zero in on the essence, seeing the forest as well the trees.
    *   **Self-aware:** They are aware of their own biases and are quick to point them out and take them into consideration when analyzing a situation.
    *   **Creative:** They can break out of established patterns of thinking and approach situations from innovative directions.
    *   **Passionate:** They have a passion for understanding and are always striving to see issues and problems with more clarity.
*   The complete liberty of the mind
*   Freedom from all social, political, or religious prejudice
*   To care for the well-being of the soul
*   Answer the question, “What is it all about?”
