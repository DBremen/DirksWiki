## Arguments: {#arguments}

### Deductive: {#deductive}

In a deductive argument, if the argument form is valid, and if you accept the supporting reasons (also called premises) as true, then you must necessarily accept the conclusion as true.

Reason/Premise: All men are mortal.

Reason/Premise: Socrates is a man.

Conclusion: Therefore, Socrates is mortal.

### Inductive: {#inductive}

An argument form in which one reasons from premises to a conclusion that is supported by the premises but does not follow necessarily from them. When you reason inductively, your premises provide evidence that makes it more or less probable (but not certain) that the conclusion is true.
