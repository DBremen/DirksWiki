# Service Management {#service-management}

For all repeated services, a process is employed to carry out the service, and a set of service management processes is used to manage the service.

The expectations of the customer are defined primarily by context.

In evaluating service quality, measurements of customers’ and stakeholders’ satisfaction are the most important.

Service management is the management of a service to ensure that it meets the critical outcomes the customer values and the stakeholders want to provide. The execution of a service is the process of performing the task, whereas service management is the process of making sure that the task is performed according to expectations.

To optimize your outcome over time, you need to monitor customers’ expectations on an ongoing basis; simply assuming that current service goals will remain static isn’t good enough. The situation is dynamic, and when customers’ expectations change, the service provider needs to recognize and respond to the changes.

To achieve this goal, measure both performance and desired outcomes. You can measure customers’ expectations by conducting customer feedback surveys and by monitoring customer responses to changes in price or other factors that affect the delivery of services. Companies use a variety of traditional surveys and Web-based monitoring tools to measure sales and customer relationship effectiveness and to keep track of performance at many levels. You must measure service activities for aspects such as cost, duration, human effort, and quality. You also need to measure progress toward the outcomes that both the customer and the stakeholders had in mind when the service was established.
