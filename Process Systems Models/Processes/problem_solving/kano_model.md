## Kano Model {#kano-model}

**Must be** attributes are the expected attributes or “musts” of a product, and do not provide an opportunity for product differentiation. Increasing the performance of these attributes provides diminishing returns in terms of customer satisfaction, however the absence or poor performance of these attributes results in extreme customer dissatisfaction. **Requirement that can dissatisfy, but cannot increase satisfaction.**

**Primary Satisfiers** Performance attributes are those for which more is generally better, and will improve customer satisfaction. Conversely, an absent or weak performance attribute reduces customer satisfaction. Of the needs customers verbalise, most will fall into the category of performance attributes. These attributes will form the weighted needs against which product concepts will be evaluated.

The price for which customer is willing to pay for a product is closely tied to performance attributes. For example, customers would be willing to pay more for a car that provides them with better fuel economy.

**Delighters** Excitement attributes are unspoken and unexpected by customers but can result in high levels of customer satisfaction, however their absence does not lead to dissatisfaction. Excitement attributes often satisfy latent needs real needs of which customers are currently unaware. In a competitive marketplace where manufacturer products provide similar performance, providing excitement attributes that address unknown needs can provide a competitive advantage. Although they have followed the typical evolution to a performance then a threshold attribute, cup holders were initially excitement attributes. **If the requirement is absent, it does not cause dissatisfaction, but it will delight clients if present**

**Other Attributes:** Products often have attributes that cannot be classified according to the Kano Model. These attributes are often of little or no consequence to the customer, and do not factor into consumer decisions. An example of this type of attribute is a plate listing part numbers can be found under the hood on many vehicles for use by repairpersons

A relatively simple approach to applying the Kano Model Analysis is to ask customers two simple questions for each attribute (Satisfied, Neutral (should be that way), Dissatisfied, does not affect my satisfaction):

**1\. Rate your satisfaction if the product has this attribute?; and**

**2\. Rate your satisfaction if the product did not have this attribute?**

*   Basic attributes generally receive the “Neutral” response to Question 1 and the Dissatisfied response to Question 2\. Exclusion of these attributes in the product has the potential to severely impact the success of the product in the marketplace.

Eliminate or include performance or excitement attributes that their presence or absence respectively lead to customer dissatisfaction. This often requires a trade-off analysis against cost. As Customers frequently rate most attributes or functionality as important, asking the question How much extra would you be willing to pay for this attribute or more of this attribute? will aid in trade-off decisions, especially for performance attributes. Prioritisation matrices can be useful in determining which excitement attributes would provide the greatest returns on Customer satisfaction

**Examples:**

Must Be = Customer receives refund

Primary Satisfier (more is better) = Refund received within timeframe

Delighter = Receiving extra present ( discount for next purchase)

CTQ = Critical to quality

Use SIPOC for stakeholder analysis

Look for waste in processes (mark value-added, non-value added and value-added but necessary process steps)

Determine process capability
