# Process Improvement handbook {#process-improvement-handbook}

In simple terms, the primary difference between a process and a procedure is that a process is what you do and a procedure is how you do it.

_Process Management_ is the ensemble of planning, engineering, improving, and monitoring an organization’s processes in order to sustain organizational performance. It is a systematic approach to making an organization’s workflow more effective, more efficient, and more capable of adapting to an ever-changing environment. A business process can be seen as a value chain or a set of activities that will be used to accomplish a specific organizational goal in order to meet customer requirements. Consequently, the goal of process management is to reduce human error and miscommunication in these processes and to focus stakeholders on improving their operating environment using Process Improvement methods.
