# Conceptualizing the problem {#conceptualizing-the-problem}

In order to solve it analytically, ideally, it first has to become clear exactly what the problem is. When that has been clarified, one can identify:

*   Who is involved in this problem (actors)
*   What all these different actors want (their objectives).

You can make a model (a simplified representation of reality) that describes the problem area in a simple but practical and useful way. Finally, you can show which measures (alternatives) the different actors can take.

Conceptualizing is iterative in nature. Initially, this analytical process appears to be sequential. First, identify precisely what the problem is, and only then take the next step of identifying the actors involved. Although you might follow the steps successively, every step forward will lead to a revision of one or more of the previous steps. When you map out what all the actors want, you will often discover that you have not defined the problem properly. When you gather alternatives, you may notice that your model of the problem area isnâ€™t complete yet. The process of conceptualizing the problem is iterative in nature.
