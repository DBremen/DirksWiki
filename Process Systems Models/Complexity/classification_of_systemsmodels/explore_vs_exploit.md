## Explore vs. Exploit {#explore-vs-exploit}

Complex systems consist of agents/parts that have interdependent rules and payoffs, which create robustness and emergent phenomena.

There is a fundamental trade-off for the agents in the system between explore and exploit.

Exploration = Searching for better solutions (continue to search for new solutions)

Exploitation = Taking advantage of what you know (use the information you found previously)

Restaurant example:There are lots of different restaurants.

If you keep searching/trying out new one’s your result will reflect the average quality of all restaurants.

If you use the knowledge you have and keep going only to the restaurants you already know and like you could miss out on something really good.

Ideally one should balance exploration against exploitation.

Rugged vs. mount fuyi landscape context:

The actor’s objective is to climb and search for elevations on the landscape with the ambition to find the highest point. There are only limited time/resources to find the highest point therefore there must be a balance between exploration and exploitation.

Going only in the direction that leads uphill and stay if there is no such direction will only lead to the first local peak in a rugged landscape, but is not effective to find the highest peak (greedy algorithm).

### Simulated annealing {#simulated-annealing}

Annealing is a process used to harden glass and metals (E.g. tempered glass or hardened steel

), or to make crystals.

Spin glass -&gt; checker board of particles pointing upwards = 1, pointing downwards = -1

The goal is to change the particles such that they all point in the same direction.

The particles/agents actually all want to point in the same direction. If the material is too cold the particles are stuck in a frustrated state. If the material’s temperature is increased the agents/particles are set free to move and try to align themselves in terms of the direction they are pointing with their neighbours. This will cause neighbourhoods of particles to point into the same direction.

At this stage the material is made gradually colder again. This will cause the bigger regions to be fixed. But the boundaries where the particles are pointing in opposite directions are still moving and will eventually all point in the same direction at which point the particles are organized and fixed since the material is cold again.

Simulated annealing applied to the hiker trying to find the highest point in a rugged landscape:

High temperature = the hiker’s moves cause a lot of mistakes (going downhill). The hiker will move around all over the place doing exploration.

Low temperature = less mistakes (mainly uphill moves).

On rugged landscapes the agents should start wit high temperature (more exploration) and then gradually do more and more exploitation to end up on a high local peak.

With dancing landscapes, the agents can never stop exploring since a peak can turn into a valley.

This is causing complexity. What is preventing the system to do too much exploration is that too much exploration would cause randomness which would cause more and more agents to find local peaks (exploitation). The benefits from exploration declines as there is more randomness and makes more sense to exploit instead.

Applied to job search or other searches it might mean that it makes sense to explore more, if you have the resources to do so.
