## How diversity gets produced in complex systems {#how-diversity-gets-produced-in-complex-systems}

*   Positive feedbacks
    *   Diversity causes more diversity
    *   The more diversity you start with (e.g. more types of materials), the more diversity you can produce.
*   Week selective pressures
    *   Not like in a bank where you need to dress a certain way
*   Different landscapes

Thinking of possible actions actors can take as moves along geographic coordinates. The fitness/success of the moves can be thought of as elevation in the landscape. The actors objective is to climb and search for elevations on the landscape with the ambition to find the highest point.

*   *   Mount Fuyi (only one peak)
    *   Rugged (multiple peaks)
*   Dancing landscapes
    *   Changing/shifting height landscapes e.g. through competition or innovation
