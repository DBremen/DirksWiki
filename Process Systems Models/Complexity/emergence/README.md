# Emergence {#emergence}

Spontaneous creation of order and functionality from the bottom up (not controlled from top-down). E.g. specific fire-flies that blink at the same time by syncing only with their neighbour and hence reaching the whole group to blink at the same time. Rather than by a central conductor that tells them when to blink.

Something that is more than the sum of its parts.

Types of emergence

*   Simple or complex
    *   Simple -&gt; macro level property in an equilibrium system (e.g. wetness of water, a single water molecule cannot be wet)
    *   Complex -&gt; macro level property that exists in complex systems not in equilibrium. (e.g. slime moles can form a snail like organism or pile up (breaking the symmetry since they know act differently even though they are all the same)
*   Strong or weak emergence
    *   Strong -&gt; what occurs at the macro level **cannot be deduced** from the interactions at the micro level (e.g. consciousness)
    *   Weak -&gt; what occurs at the macro level **cannot be expected** from the interactions at the micro level, but can be explained once it is observed. (e.g. slime moles)
