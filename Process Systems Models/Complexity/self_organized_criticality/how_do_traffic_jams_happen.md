## How do traffic jams happen? {#how-do-traffic-jams-happen}

If a car slows down when there are many other cars driving behind it, the others cars will have to slow down too. Even if the car in front will accelerate again it will take the other cars much longer to take up speed again.

It might take long enough for others cars driving behind the lane of cars also having to queue behind the same lane.

This can then cascade down to more cars causing a traffic jam.
