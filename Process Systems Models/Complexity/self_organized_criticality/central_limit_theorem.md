## Central limit theorem {#central-limit-theorem}

if we add or average samples of individual independent events, they will be normally distributed (e.g. weight of loaf of bread).

*   Regardless of their distribution
*   They only need to have finite variance (not too extreme)

This contributes to the stability of society since it makes events predictable (there are usually not many events that deviate by large from the mean).
