Firms would be better of with high prices but since they are individually better off with lower (gaining more market share over the competition) prices they will end up with lower prices.

*   2 banks decide either not to buy ATM machines or to buy ATM machines
*   If they don&#039;t buy ATM  machines Both make profits of, let&#039;s say, four.
*   if one of them buys buys ATM machines, and puts them up all over town, everyone will go to that bank.
*   The other bank is forced to do the same. Now, both of them have probably the same customers they had to start out with, but  they&#039;ve spent all this money on ATM machines. So they&#039;re actually worse off. 
*   In fact, it could even be worse than that. Because maybe before, part of  the reason they made such profits is because they got geographic grants. People  who lived around the bank shopped at that bank. Now that there&#039;s ATM machines  anywhere, people can shop whatever bank they want. And that&#039;s created more price  competition, we end up with the consumers being better off.
