# Mechanism Design {#mechanism-design}

An institution consists of a means through which people communicate information as well as a procedure for making decisions, reallocating resources, or producing outputs based on the information revealed. In markets, people and firms communicate through prices to execute trades and make production decisions. In hierarchies, people communicate through written language to organize work plans. And in democracies, people communicate preferences through votes. Voting rules then decide policies. Well-designed institutions induce communications and actions that produce desirable outcomes. Ineffective institutions do not.

Mechanism Design highlight four aspects of institutions:

1.  **information**, what the participants know and should be revealed to them;
2.  **incentives**, the benefits and costs of taking particular actions
3.  how the individual **incentives** actions translate into collective **outcomes**;
4.  **computational costs**, the cognitive demand placed on participants.
