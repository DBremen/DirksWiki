## Mount-Reiter diagram {#mount-reiter-diagram}

A mechanism consists of six parts:

1.  an environment (the relevant features of the world)
2.  set of outcomes,
3.  a set of actions (called the message space)
4.  a behavioral rule that people follow to produce actions
5.  an outcome function that maps the actions into outcomes
6.  a social choice correspondence that maps the environment into a set of hoped-for outcomes.

Within a set of outcomes, an outcome is **Pareto dominated** if there exists an alternative that everyone prefers. All other outcomes are **Pareto efficient**.

For an example of Pareto efficiency, consider the following four payoff profiles for three people:

*   {(3, 3, 4), (9, 0, 0), (0, 8, 1), (2, 2, 3)}
*   All except (2, 2, 3) are Pareto efficient. The allocation (2, 2, 3) is dominated by (3, 3, 4).
