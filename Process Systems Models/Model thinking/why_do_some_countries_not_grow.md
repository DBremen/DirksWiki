# Why do some countries not grow? {#why-do-some-countries-not-grow}

*   Growth requires a strong central government to protect capital and investment
    *   BUT that government cannot be controlled by a select few. Extraction (by protected government supporters) limits growth by lowering investment and capital.
*   Increases in innovation means less labor is required.
*   Growth requires creative destruction
    *   Growth rates are supported by innovation in the long run.
