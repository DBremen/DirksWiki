# Collective action problems {#collective-action-problems}

There is a cost to the individual if they take action but, yet a benefit to all if they do so. (free rider problem)

Assume 10 people with cooperation payoff = 1 and defection payoff = 0 for everyone and ÃŸ = 0.6\. If x<sub>1</sub> defects his payoff is 5.4 but if cooperates his payoff is 5.0 so it is his advantage to defect to the expense of his colleagues.

x<sub>1</sub> takes action: 0 + .6 * 9 = 5.4 - 0 because no cost of taking action; 9 because x<sub>1</sub> takes no action

x<sub>1</sub> takes no action: -1 + .6 * 10 = 5 - -1 = cost for x<sub>1</sub> to take action; 10 = including x<sub>1.</sub>
