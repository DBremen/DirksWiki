# Bernoulli {#bernoulli}

A player who makes 46% of his three-pointers has about a 1/1000probability of making nine in a row (0.46<sup>9</sup>). If that player keeps taking three-pointers, then in a ten-year NBA career (about 800 games), the odds of not making nine in a row at least once (0.999<sup>800</sup>) are about 47%.
