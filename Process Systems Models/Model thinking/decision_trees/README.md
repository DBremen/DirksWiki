Imagine the following scenario. You&#039;re planning a trip to a city and you&#039;ve got a ticket to go to the museum, letâ€™s say from one to two. And suppose the museum is quite a way from the train station. So, you look at train ticket prices and you see you can buy a ticket for the three o&#039;clock train. For only $200\. But the four o&#039;clock train is $400\. You know, should I try and save money by buying that ticket for the three o&#039;clock train before it sells out? Now there&#039;s a 40 percent chance you&#039;re not going to make. The train. So now you got to think, oh my gosh, should I but the ticket or not? Give there&#039;s a 40 percent chance I&#039;m not going to make it. And if I don&#039;t make it, then I&#039;m going to have to buy two tickets. I&#039;m going to basically throw away the $200\.

.6*200+.4*600 = 360 vs. 400 better go for the buy option.

First essay chance to win = 10/200 = 5% (10 finalists out of 200)

Second essay prob. = 1/10 = 10%

Cost to write 2 p. = 20; cost to write 10 p. = 40
