# Mechanism design {#mechanism-design}

Designing incentive structures so that we get the sort of outcomes we want.

Reveal hidden actions/information.

Incentive compatibility = It makes sense for a worker to put in effort if the amount of money received minus the cost of effort must be greater than or equal to the probability that if they slack off, the outcome will be good anyways.
