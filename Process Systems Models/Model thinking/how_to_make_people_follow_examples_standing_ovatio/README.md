# How to make people follow examples (standing ovation model) {#how-to-make-people-follow-examples-standing-ovation-model}

**Sorting** – People that hang out together tend to act and look alike. People that act and look alike tend to live and hang out together. (as a result, people would move)

**PEER EFFECTS**- Stop smoking because of peer influences (looking, acting like peers) (as a result people would switch)

*   **Other Considerations:** (a) layout of the auditorium, (b) group you are with (e.g., date)
*   **Layout:** (a) Celebrity Effect – people in front see far fewer ‘standing’ signals from the audience behind them.They ‘don’t care’ what the others are doing, BUT others see them and are thus, ‘influenced’ by whether they stand or not: hence, the Celebrity Effect.(b) Those in the back see a large portion of the audience and are thus more prone to stand, triggered by their X% threshold. But whether the back-row folks stand or not, has significantly less effect than front rowers. Note “they see what’s going on, but nobody pays any attention to them [academics].”
*   **Group (dates, pairs, groups):** More likely to do what your ‘group’ does.
*   **Ways to foster standing ovation: 1) Higher Quality, 2) Lower Threshold, 3) Larger Peer Effects, 4) More Variation (**More Variation in perceived quality**), 5) Use Celebrities, 6) Many Big Groups**

*   **Fertility:** the Standing Ovation model is a useful template for other problems, e.g., (a) **_Collective Action_**: (consider the value of celebrities), (b) **_Academic Performance_**: (celebrities, groups, raise quality, lower thresholds), (c) **Urban Renewal:** (‘fixing up your house’, small amounts of $ for everyone may not trigger T, but large $ for a few homeowners (E) may trigger a cascade as others try to match their neighbor’s improved home),(d) **_Fitness / Health_**: (peer effects, information by seeing other’s results, ..)(e) **_Online Course_** (celebrities, etc.**)**
