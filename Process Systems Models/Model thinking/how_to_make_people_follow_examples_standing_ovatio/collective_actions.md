## Collective actions {#collective-actions}

Threshold to buy a purple hat (if x amount has the hat, I buy it too):

| **Person** | **Threshold** | **Will the buy?** |  | **Person** | **Threshold** | **Will the buy?** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 1 | No |  | 1 | 0 | **Yes** |
| 2 | 1 | No |  | 2 | 1 | **Yes** |
| 3 | 1 | No |  | 3 | 2 | **Yes** |
| 4 | 2 | No |  | 4 | 3 | **Yes** |
| 5 | 2 | No |  | 5 | 4 | **Yes** |
| **Average** | 1.4 |  |  | **Average** | 2 |  |

**Collective Action:** More likely **(a) if lower thresholds** and **(b) if more variation in the thresholds**Note that more variation implies more likely to have some lower thresholds in the population to trigger and epidemic of behavior change. Not just average thresholds but distribution of thresholds determines cascades.
