Strategic Situation -&gt; What is best for you depends on what others do.

Rational actors = those that maximize payoffs

Game theory -&gt; constructs mathematical models to examine or predict how people behave in strategic situations.

1.  Individuals will try their best when competing against each other
2.  Under a certain set of rules.

Social problems can be formulated as mathematical models -&gt; Games.

The model consists the following components:

*   The players
*   Strategy (what each player can do, which actions they can take) usually denoted as a<sub>i</sub>
    *   Strategy set = range of strategies players can use denoted as A<sub>i</sub>
*   Payoffs denoted as g<sub>i.</sub> They usually depend on the other players strategies/actions: (a<sub>1,</sub>a<sub>2</sub>â€¦)
