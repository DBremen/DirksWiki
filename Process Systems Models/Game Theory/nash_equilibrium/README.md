# Nash equilibrium {#nash-equilibrium}

Surface of a coffee stirred in a cup as an analogy to the set of possible human behavior.

Nash discovered that every social problem has a “stable point” where all individual are doing there best against each others -&gt; Nash equilibrium

If two players are choosing to play the Nash equilibrium strategy. No one can gain(getting a higher payoff) by deviating from this strategy on their own. The Nash equilibrium represents the mutually best response.

It represents a combination of strategies in which no single player can increase their payoff by deviating unilateraly. This is a unified solution concept that can be applied in a wide range of games.
