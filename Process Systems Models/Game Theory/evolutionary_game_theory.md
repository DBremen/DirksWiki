# Evolutionary game theory {#evolutionary-game-theory}

Assuming zero-intelligent actors with adaption through mutation and natural selection (survival of the fittest)

Payoff = Successful strategy has more offspring.

The survival of the fittest does not lead to one species overtaking every one else or one species always being optimal. Because of Nash equilibrium like in the prisonersâ€™ dilemma there is a benefit for mutant genes or species to defect.
