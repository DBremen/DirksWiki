# Understanding how others think (mind perception) {#understanding-how-others-think-mind-perception}

Whether people have a consciousness/mind is usually perceived based along two dimensions or metrics:

*   Agency/Thinkers/Actions
*   Experience/Feelers (whether one can feel based on external inputs)

While babies and animals have feelings/experience they donâ€™t have as much agency as adults. Companies have agency but no feelings.
