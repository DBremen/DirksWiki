### People make moral judgements based on these mind perceptions {#people-make-moral-judgements-based-on-these-mind-perceptions}

Typically, the more you see someone as a thinker, the lesser you see them as a feeler.

When it comes to punishment or taking responsibility it’s usually based those attributes. One that does not feel is not being punished nor made responsible. One that feels but doesn’t have the capacity for agency is usually not made responsible.

This also applies to adults. E.g. hero vs. victim strategy for people that are guilty of a crime. The victim strategy emphasizes on showing that the person has feelings and not so much on agency, hence the punishment will be lesser than if the person is showcased as a hero with the emphasis on agency.

When going for a job interview on the other hand it’s better to be perceived as a thinker by wearing a business suit rather than showing too much skin.
