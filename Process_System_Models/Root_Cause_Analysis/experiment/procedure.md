## Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Create a test plan based on a hypothesis. The predicted result of the hypothesis is the response variable.
2.  Determine the treatment conditions by establishing the treatment variable or variables.
3.  Identify potential confounding variables and establish a method to eliminate, control, or minimize them. Blocking and randomization may be useful here.
4.  Ensure all terms are written as operational definitions.
5.  Establish the baseline if necessary or possible.
6.  Perform the experiment.
7.  Replicate the experiment and compare the results; a large difference is an indicator that variation is present and more replicates are needed.
