## Key Points {#key-points}

*   The scientific method is empirical/ evidence based.
*   A hypothesis is a key part of using the scientific method.
*   Quick iterations of the iterative inductive- deductive process can lead to the root cause.
*   The objective should not be to immediately identify a root cause but rather to move quickly through the cycles of PDCA to reject unsupported hypotheses and arrive at the root cause.
*   Avoid holding on to a pet hypothesis once it is unequivocally disproved. Evaluating an incorrect hypothesis is not bad; defending one is.
