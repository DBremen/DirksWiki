## Diversity produces innovation {#diversity-produces-innovation}

Combinations:

Imagine Thomas Edison had 100 jars of elements on his shelf in his laboratory.

To choose 2 jars there 100 choices to take one jar and 99 choices to take the 2<sup>nd</sup> jar. Since order does matter (i.e. element1 + element2 is the same as element2 + element1) we need to divide the result by two:

Numbers of combinations to pick 2 out of 100 = 100 * 99 /1* 2 = 4950

3 out of 100 = 100 * 99 * 98 / 1*2*3 =

4 out of 100 = 100 * 99 * 98 * 97 / 1*2*3*4

Also diversity of thought/ideas i.e. different ways of seeing or representing things can lead to reaching another peak.
