# Classification of systems/models {#classification-of-systems-models}

based on:

1.  the rules followed by its parts
2.  the initial state of the system
    *   family at a dinner table
    *   family in a car for 36 hours

Classifications:

1.  single point equilibria (ball in a bowl)
2.  regular patterns (stop light)
3.  chaotic

*   extremely sensitive to initial conditions (starting at the same point under slightly different conditions will end up at a completely different point)

1.  complex
    *   no regular behaviour
    *   no regular pattern
    *   structure not easily discernible
