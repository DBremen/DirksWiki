## Diversity produces robustness {#diversity-produces-robustness}

Robustness = Ability to maintain functionality despite disturbance

Variation produces robustness

*   Having a set of screwdrivers enables you to respond to fix any screw that is loose.
*   Variation in beaks of a population of birds of a specific type makes them robust against environmental changes (e.g. Darwinâ€™s finches)

Diversity produces robustness

*   Set of different tools enables you even better to respond to any problems.
*   The more species there are, the more likely it is that at least one of them will survive any kind of change.
