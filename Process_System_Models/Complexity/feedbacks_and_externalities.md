# Feedbacks and externalities {#feedbacks-and-externalities}

Feedback -&gt; dependencies between the same actions

Externalities -&gt; dependencies between different actions (e.g. the more flowers the more vases are needed). There are positive and negative externalities.

*   Positive feedback (more creates more, actions that create more of the same) can lead to tipping points
*   Negative feedback (more creates less, gas prices increase -&gt; less people buy gas -&gt; gas prizes go down) can create stability
*   Combinations of positive feedback and negative externalities can create path-dependence
    *   Path-dependence: future outcomes depend on the actions along the way. Outcomes in path-dependent processes can be difficult to understand.
*   Usually based on threshold rule. E.g. what is the % of people that run for the exit for me to run for the exit, too?
*   In complex systems (that are diverse) the extreme thresholds (at the tails of the distribution) can have a big impact on the behaviour of the system:
    *   E.g. people leaving mall based on how many other people are leaving. If the threshold is j for every j person (threshold:personN: 1:1, 2:2, ….) then there will be a cascade effect if only one person leaves that will make everyone follow. As compared to everyone having a threshold of 5, where nothing happens until at least 5 people leave.
    *   The same effect can lead to stock market crashes (the system is tipping) and segregated neighbourhoods (even though individual tolerance levels are pretty high)
    *   There won’t be a tipping that moves the system back into the other direction.
