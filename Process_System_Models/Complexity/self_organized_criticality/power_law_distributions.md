## Power law distributions {#power-law-distributions}

Some events are not normally distributed but power laws(e.g. cost overrun of projects, war size, floods, earth quake).

In a power law distribution huge events are not likely, but they can occur.

Event sizes follow a power law if the probability of an event of size x is proportional to x raised to some negative power. (e.g. with an exponent of 2, the probability of an event with the size of 100 is 1/100^2.

If you measure how long it takes to return to 0 in a game where I get 1$ for heads for a coin flip and you get 1$ for tail it will resemble a power law distribution. Most of the time it will only take few steps to go back to 0$ but some times it will take a long time.
