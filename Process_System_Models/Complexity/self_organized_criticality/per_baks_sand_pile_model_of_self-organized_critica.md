## Per Bakâ€™s sand pile model of self-organized criticality {#per-bak-s-sand-pile-model-of-self-organized-criticality}

In reality (if not simulated on a computer) the sand box model better works with rice.

If you drop individual rice corns on a square table rice piles up on the table. A pile is going to build up. At one point the pile gets high enough so that additional rice corns will cause an avalanche causing some of the rice corns to drop to the floor. Most of the time there will be only few rice grains dropping to the floor. But some times there will be huge avalanches. The distribution of the avalanche sizes will follow a power law.

If we replace the table in the sand pile model with a checker board and the sand with people from a group called bridge player anonymous. Every person will drop on a specific square of the checker board.

Members of the group would like to avoid meeting in groups greater than 4\. Because of 4 of them meet on a square they might want to start a game of bridge.

If at any point 4 people of the group do meet at the same square they will go off in 4 different directions.

Eventually this system will self-organize into a critical state where dropping additional people will lead to huge cascades of movements (similar to the avalanches within the sand pile model) because of the **connectedness and interdependence within the system**.
