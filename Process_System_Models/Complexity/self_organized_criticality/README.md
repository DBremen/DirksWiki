# Self organized criticality {#self-organized-criticality}

Systems self organize if the aggregation of individual actions produced an organized pattern at the macro level (e.g. bird flocks, fish shoals). A system is set to be critical if small events trigger large cascades. If a system self organizes into a critical state it is called self-organized criticality.
