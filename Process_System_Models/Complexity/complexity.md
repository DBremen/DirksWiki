# Complexity {#complexity}

An actor in a complex system controls almost nothing but influences everything.

Depends on:

*   Diversity (see further down for details)
    *   Applied to chemical elements:
        *   Mixing the same type of elements will not lead to anything interesting.
        *   Mixing few components together leads to new (sometimes emergent) phenomena.
        *   Mixing a lot of elements together leads to a mess.
*   Connectedness (how many people a person connects to)
*   Interdependence (whether other entities influence actions)
*   Adaptation/Learning

Complex systems don’t lie at the extremes of those attributes but at a moderate level.

It’s easier to analyse games/models with only two players or an infinite number of numbers since they are not complex.

A complex system produces interesting non-periodic patterns and emergent structures and functionalities.

Social systems are usually complex because their attributes (diversity, connectedness, interdependence, adaptation) at a moderate level.
