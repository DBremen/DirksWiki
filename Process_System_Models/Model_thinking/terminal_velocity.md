# Terminal velocity {#terminal-velocity}

**Terminal velocity** is the maximum velocity attainable by an object as it falls through a [fluid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid) ([air](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air) is the most common example).

Falling skydivers reach terminal velocities of 200 mph. Terminal velocities scale with the inverse of mass. Assume that a skydiver has a mass 400 times larger than the stuffed cheetah. For a heavy object, the terminal velocity is generally greater than a light object. This is because air resistance is proportional to the falling body&#039;s velocity squared. The square root of 400 equals 20\. Therefore, the terminal velocity of the stuffed cheetah will equal 200 mph divided by 20, or 10 mph.

| Object | Mass | Terminal velocity |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sky diver | 100 kg | 200 kph |
| Stuffed animal | 100/400 = .25 kg | 200 kph / Sqrt(100 kg / .25 kg) = 10 kph |
