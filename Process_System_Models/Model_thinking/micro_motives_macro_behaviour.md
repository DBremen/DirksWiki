# Micro motives Macro behaviour {#micro-motives-macro-behaviour}

That is: observed macrobehavior does not automatically imply biased micromotives!

Schelling model of segregation model (Schelling’s Tipping Model -&gt; Agent based model). When deciding whether to stay or move house within a neighborhood each person has a threshold of how much they like to be with alike people based on which they decide to stay or move (e.g. Sonja&#039;s current threshold is 35%, i.e., she needs at least 35% of her neighbors to be of the same type in order for her to remain at her location.)

Even though people might be comfortable with only 30 to 40% of their neighbors being like them, the mathematics of that preference shows that sorting of the sort seen in the New York map above is the natural consequence. The acceptable micropreferences (microbehavior) does not produce the macrobehavior that is believed to be desireable by politicians or even what X believes they would like in diveristy.

*   **Threshold = 40%:** =&gt; initially 28.8% unhappy and sorting yeilds 79.5% similarity to neighbors and 0% unhappy
*   **Threshold = 52%:** initially 50.6% similar &amp; 57.4% unhappy. Sorting yields 93.8% similar with 0% unhappy. Note ‘black’ boundary (empty) homes.
*   **Threshold &gt;= 80%:** Initially 50.6% similar and 89.6% unhappy. Sorting is not stable as happiness threshold cannot be met. In reality this suggests people move continuously. Moving continuously, churning
