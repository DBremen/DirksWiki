# Condorcet&#039;s Jury Theorem {#condorcet-s-jury-theorem}

Condorcet&#039;s jury theorem states that given a group of voters (a &quot;jury&quot;) independently choosing by majority vote between a correct outcome with probability ![0<=p<=1](C:\scripts\DirksWiki\Process_System_Models\Model_thinking\assets\0=p=1.gif)and an incorrect one with probability ![1-p](C:\scripts\DirksWiki\Process_System_Models\Model_thinking\assets\1-p.gif):

1\. If ![p>1/2](C:\scripts\DirksWiki\Process_System_Models\Model_thinking\assets\p12.gif)(so that each voter is more likely to vote correctly that incorrectly), adding more voters increases the probability that the majority chooses correctly and the probability of a correct decision approaches 1 as the number of voters increases;

2\. If ![p<1/2](C:\scripts\DirksWiki\Process_System_Models\Model_thinking\assets\p12.gif)(so that each voter is less likely to vote incorrectly than correctly), adding more voters decreases the probability that the majority chooses correctly and the probability of a correct decision is maximized for a jury of size one.
