# Classes of outcomes {#classes-of-outcomes}

*   Equilibrium
*   Cyclic
*   Random
*   Complex

A pencil resting on a desk is in equilibrium. The planets orbiting the sun are in a cycle. A sequence of coin flips is random, so are (approximately) stock prices on the New York Stock Exchange, as we shall learn in the next chapter. Finally, the neuronal firings in a personâ€™s brain are complex; they do not fire randomly, nor do they fire in a fixed pattern.
