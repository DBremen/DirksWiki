# Randomness {#randomness}

Outcome **= a (luck) + (1-a) (skill) – with a 0 &lt;= a &lt;= 1**

*   Use performance to determine a.
*   If the outcome is consistent then a is small (luck doesn’t play a big role). If the outcome is showing huge variations a is big.

**Reasons to use this model**

(a) the model helps to assess outcomes

(b) anticipate reversion to the mean (if luck is involved people will not win or lose consistently)

(c) give good discerning feedback (in case the outcome is due to skill)

(d) fair allocation of resources (skill or luck(fairness).

**The Paradox of Skill (Maubossin): When you have the very best competing, the differences in their skill levels may be close. So the winner will be determined by luck!**

**Random walks.**

**Summary: An outcome may be a series of random events and thus we should expect to see some big winners and some big losers. So we cannot expect past performance to be a good indicator of future performance. Thus key question is – is this a random walk process – or not? If so, expect regression to the mean.**

**Efficient Market Hypothesis helps explain although there may be some deviations / challenges as noted in the critiques.**

Depends on 5 latest layers

This is like a sliding window of randomness affects the overall outcome (e.g. employees leaving and new employees getting hired; new and old products, team’s of players)
