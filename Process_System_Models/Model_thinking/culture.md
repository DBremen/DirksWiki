# Culture {#culture}

Summary: Basic Cultural properties: there&#039;s a lot of difference between cultures, and those difference may arise because the fact that people need to coordinate within groups with which they interact. There&#039;s also consistency within cultures, and that happens because it gets cognitively easier to do the same behavior in lots of different domains. And then third, we see a lot of heterogeneity within cultures. And that happens, as we saw by using a Markov analysis on our model, because if people just make small mistakes or occasionally try an innovation, those differences are going to propagate through the population in two ways; within an individual and across individuals. And that&#039;s going to give us a lot of within-culture heterogeneity. So cultures differ between themselves. Cultures differ within themselves. But they still have this consistency. They have what you might call a cultural signature. These very simple models combined with our tools of Lyapunov functions and Markov processes have helped us understand why that happens.
