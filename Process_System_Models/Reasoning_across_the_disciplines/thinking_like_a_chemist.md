Heat is preserved, it is only transferred. This is how the sun provides us with Energy.

The sum of the elements (neutrons, protons, electrons (negligible)) is lesser than the sum of their weights because energy is released when they join into the nucleus of an atom (E=mc<sup>2</sup>)

E=mc<sup>2</sup> shows that there is a lot of energy stored in a small amount of mass (since the mass is multiplied by the speed of light and squared)

Energy is the ability to do work, such as moving objects or transferring heat.

Mass is measured in kg

Weight in Newtons
