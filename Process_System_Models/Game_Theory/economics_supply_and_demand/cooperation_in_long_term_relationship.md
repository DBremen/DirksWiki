## Cooperation in long term relationship {#cooperation-in-long-term-relationship}

Example with two gas stations that are right next to each other. Assumptions:

*   Same product
*   Same unit cost (production cost) = 2$
*   If the price is different all customers go to the cheaper stations
*   If the price is equal all customers will be split equally

But the outcome is not sustainable since one gas station can undercut the price (just slightly) in order to win all the profit.

The Nash equilibrium in this case is both gas stations charging $2\. If one gas station will increase the price customers will keep going to the cheaper station. If one gas station is trying to undercut $2, they will not gain either since they will decrease their profit (making it negative).

The above is only true if the game is playing paid only once. Since the game is being played continuously, they are establishing a long-term relationship.

*   Same players
*   Play the same game continuously

Repeated game. If the game played every day is a price competition, it’s also called “stage game”.

To evaluate the impact of this strategy we need to take a discounted future payoff into consideration (a payoff today is worth less than a payoff tomorrow).

What happens if one gas stations decides to undercut the prices of the other on 1<sup>st</sup> March?
