## Nash equilibrium example1 {#nash-equilibrium-example1}

Determine the Nash equilibrium before and after the construction of the new bypass.

Nash equilibrium = No traveler can save time by changing their route.

Nash equilibrium (without Bypass):

| Route | Cars | Route length | Payoff |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 25 | 350 | 375 |
| 2 | 125 | 250 | 375 |
|  |  |  | **750** |

Nash equilibrium (with Bypass):

| Route | Cars | Route length | Payoff |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 0 | 350 | 0 |
| 2 | 50 | 250 | 300 |
| 3 | 100 | 200 | 300 |
|  |  |  | **600** |

Travel time saved by bypass = 150.
