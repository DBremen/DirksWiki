## Prisoner’s dilemma {#prisoner-s-dilemma}

Two members of a criminal gang are arrested and imprisoned. Each prisoner is in solitary confinement with no means of communicating with the other. The prosecutors lack sufficient evidence to convict the pair on the principal charge, but they have enough to convict both on a lesser charge. Simultaneously, the prosecutors offer each prisoner a bargain. Each prisoner is given the opportunity either to betray the other by testifying that the other committed the crime, or to cooperate with the other by remaining silent. The possible outcomes are:

*   If A and B each betray the other, each of them serves 10 years in prison
*   If A betrays B but B remains silent, A will be set free and B will serve 15 years in prison
*   If A remains silent but B betrays A, A will serve 15 years in prison and B will be set free
*   If A and B both remain silent, both of them will serve only one year in prison (on the lesser charge).

| ½ | Cooperate | Defect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cooperate | -1,-1 | -15,0 |
| Defect | 0,-15 | -10,-10 |

*   If your opponent cooperates your best choice is to defect (-1 vs. 0 payoff)
*   If your opponent defects your best choice is the defect too (-15 vs. -10)
*   To always defect is the best choice (-10,-10) = Nash equilibrium
*   The dilemma occurs because individual’s rationality does not lead to the overall best choice (-1,-1)
    *   What is best for the group (group rationality) is not always equal to a result based on each of the individual’s rationality choices.
