# CMMI for services {#cmmi-for-services}

CMMI ® (Capability Maturity Model ® Integration) models are collections of best practices that help organizations to improve their processes. The CMMI-SVC model provides guidance for applying CMMI best practices in a service provider organization. Best practices in the model focus on activities for providing quality services to customers and end users.

A Capability Maturity Model ® (CMM ® ), including CMMI, is a simplified representation of the world. CMMs contain the essential elements of effective processes.

The SEI has taken the process management premise, “the quality of a system or product is highly influenced by the quality of the process used to develop and maintain it,” and defined CMMs that embody this premise.

The CMM Integration ® project was formed to sort out the problem of using multiple CMMs. The combination of selected models into a single improvement framework was intended for use by organizations in their pursuit of enterprise-wide process improvement. Developing a set of integrated models involved more than simply combining existing model materials. Using processes that promote consensus, the CMMI Product Team built a framework that accommodates multiple constellations.

The CMMI Framework provides the structure needed to produce CMMI models, training, and appraisal components. To allow the use of multiple models within the CMMI Framework, model components are classified as either common to all CMMI models or applicable to a specific model. The common material is called the “CMMI Model Foundation” or “CMF.”

The components of the CMF are part of every model generated from the CMMI Framework. Those components are combined with material applicable to an area of interest (e.g., acquisition, development, services) to produce a model.

A “constellation” is defined as a collection of CMMI components that are used to construct models, training materials, and appraisal related documents for an area of interest (e.g., acquisition, development, services). The Services constellation’s model is called “CMMI for Services” or “CMMI-SVC.”

CMMI-SVC draws on concepts and practices from CMMI and other service focused standards and models, including the following:

*   Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL)
*   ISO/IEC 20000: Information Technology—Service Management
*   Control Objectives for Information and related Technology (CobiT)
*   Information Technology Services Capability Maturity Model (ITSCMM)

The CMMI-SVC model covers the activities required to establish, deliver, and manage services. As defined in the CMMI context, a service is an intangible, non-storable product. The CMMI-SVC model has been developed to be compatible with this broad definition.

The Software Engineering Institute (SEI) has found several dimensions that an organization can focus on to improve its business.

Organizations typically focus on:

*   People
*   procedures and methods
*   tools and equipment

What holds everything together? It is the processes used in your organization. Processes allow you to align the way you do business. They allow you to address scalability and provide a way to incorporate knowledge of how to do things better. Processes allow you to leverage your resources and to examine business trends.

This is not to say that people and technology are not important. We are living in a world where technology is changing at an incredible speed. Similarly, people typically work for many companies throughout their careers. We live in a dynamic world. A focus on process provides the infrastructure and stability necessary to deal with an ever-changing world and to maximize the productivity of people and the use of technology to be competitive.
