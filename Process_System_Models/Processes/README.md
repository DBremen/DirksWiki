Questions to ask about a process

*   What are the handoffs (it&#039;s not a process if there are not at least 2-3 handoffs)
*   What are the ways the process can go wrong
*   What are the ways the process can produce positive/negative outcomes
*   What value does the process deliver to the customer?
*   Who are the customers of the process?
*   What business processes are affected by a business rule change

Separate business rules from processes
