## Data {#data}

*   Look at the distribution rather than only averages
*   Narrow range of distribution and reduce variation. Reduced variation = higher process stability
*   Look at defects rather than averages
*   Know the CCRs
*   At 6 Sigma the customer requirement is 6 standard deviations from the mean of the process output. If a process runs at 6 six sigma there are only 3.4 defects out of 1 million.
*   Measure performance against process capability
