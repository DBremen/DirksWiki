## Kant: {#kant}

Sensations would be nothing to us, and would not concern us in the least, if they were not received into our (orderly) consciousness. Knowledge is impossible in any other way. . . . For perceptions could not be perceptions of anything for me unless they . . . could at least be connected together into (my) one conscious- ness. This principle stands firm a priori, and may be called “the transcendental principle of unity” for all the multiplicity of our perceptions and sensations.

**The entire reality, which we assume to be completely independent of ourselves, is in fact, as Kant maintained, constituted by the active structuring of our minds. Categories or schemata (such as time, space, cause and effect) are universally present in normally functioning humans, we all share a common universe, constituted and defined by the same basic qualities and relations.**

**Universal concepts:**

*   Unity, plurality, and totality for concept of quantity; 
*   reality, negation, and limitation, for the concept of quality; 
*   inherence and subsistence, cause and effect, and community for the concept of relation; 
*   possibility-impossibility, existence-nonexistence, and necessity and contingency for the concept of modality.
