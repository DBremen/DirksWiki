## Character: Virtue Ethics {#character-virtue-ethics}

For Aristotle and other believers in virtue ethics, it is the cultivation of a virtuous character that is the goal of ethics, to become a virtuous person. The assumption is that genuinely virtuous people will act in morally principled ways as a natural expression of their moral goodness. And these moral actions will in turn strengthen their virtuous nature.

Aristotle points out that, though we desire pleasure, wealth, fame, and success, we desire them mainly because we hope that they will bring us happiness. Similarly, people often strive to achieve virtues such as honor and intellectual insight, though again the ultimate aim is to be happy.

Doctrine of the Golden Mean, a moral philosophy that is based on the concepts of temperance (moderation), self-discipline, and balance (an approach analogous to the Middle Way practiced in Buddhism).

Virtue then is a state of deliberate moral purpose consisting in a mean that is relative to ourselves, the mean being determined by reason, or as a prudent man would determine it.
