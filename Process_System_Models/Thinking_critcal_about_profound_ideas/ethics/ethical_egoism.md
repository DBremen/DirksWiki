Ayn Rand

The virtue of altruism that traditional ethical theories and religions recommend is actually a vice because it encourages people not to pursue their own self-interest as their top priority.

*   Confusion 1: It is false to believe that selfishness means the same thing as self-interest.
*   Confusion 2: It is false to say that every action is done either from self-interest or from other-regarding motives.
*   Confusion 3: It is false to assume that a concern for oneâ€™s own welfare is incompatible with any genuine concern for the welfare of others.

Do the gods love piety because it is pious, or is it pious because they love it? In other words, is a moral value good or right because God commands it to be so, or is the moral value good or right independently of God s commands (though it is presumably consistent with divine moral values)?
