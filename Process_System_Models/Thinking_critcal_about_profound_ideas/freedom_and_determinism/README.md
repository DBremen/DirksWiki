# FREEDOM AND DETERMINISM {#freedom-and-determinism}

**External vs. internal forces**

**If you are limited by external forces**, the way to free yourself is to neutralize or remove them, so that you can make choices that reflect your genuine desires. For example, if your choices are constrained by an unreasonable boss, you have to either change that person s coercive behavior or remove yourself from the situation to achieve genuine freedom. If you believe that your choices are excessively limited by the geographical location in which you live, you might have to move in order to increase your possibilities.
