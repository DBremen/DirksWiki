## Descartes {#descartes}

**Cogito, ergo sum = I think, therefore I am.**

Descartes confesses that he has come to the conclusion that virtually everything he has been taught from authorities and other adults is questionable and likely false. His radical solution? To establish a fresh start on gaining true, well-supported beliefs by simply erasing his endorsement of anything he has previously been taught.

**Cogito, ergo sum** is the first principle of Descartes theory of knowledge because he is confident that no rational person will doubt his or her own existence as a conscious, thinking entity while we are aware of thinking about our self. Even if we are dreaming or hallucinating, even if our consciousness is being manipulated by some external entity, it is still my self-aware self that is dreaming, hallucinating, or being manipulated.

**If your self-identity is dependent on the fact that you are capable of being aware you are engaging in these mental operations while you are engaged in them. If you were consistently not conscious of your mental operations, consistently unaware of your thinking, reasoning, and perceiving processes, then it would not be possible for you to have a self-identity, a unique essence, a you.**
