## Buddhism {#buddhism}

**Milindapanha, The Simile of the Chariot (http://www.usna.edu/Users/history/abels/hh205/milinda.html)**

For Buddhists, every aspect of life is impermanent, and all elements of the universe are in a continual process of change and transition, a process that includes each self as well. The self can best be thought of as a flame that is continually passed from candle to candle, retaining a certain continuity but no real personal identity a concept very different from the self of Western consciousness.

According to Buddhist philosophy, the self is composed of five aggregates:

1.  physical form
2.  sensation
3.  conceptualization
4.  dispositions to act
5.  consciousness

Each self is comprised of the continual interplay of these five elements, but there is no substance or identity beyond the dynamic interaction of these five elements.
