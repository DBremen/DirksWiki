# Stopping the rage {#stopping-the-rage}

*   Focus on your anger and the reactions to your anger rather than the source of your anger
*   Respond rather than react
    *   Your response is predictable (not unpredictable as when you are angry)
    *   Thoughtful
    *   Not impulsive
    *   In control
*   Repeat to yourself as many times as necessary, “This too shall pass.”
*   Breathe
    *   Take a deep, exaggerated breath in through your nose.
    *   Hold the breath for a count of one
    *   Now, exhale in an exaggerated way through your mouth.
    *   Repeat the exercise at least ten times
    *   Think the word release with each exhale. This is your mind’s command to the body to let go of this unwanted tension. Your body will follow the command.
*   Just by being quiet for a few moments, while you continue to formulate your response to anger, you’ll begin to calm down.
*   Ask yourself 4 questions
    *   Who am I really angry at?
    *   Is this the right time and place to be angry?
    *   Why am I angry?
    *   Is the intensity of my anger consistent with why I’m angry?
*   Come up with other alternatives as to why the other person did what she did to trigger your rage
    *   Then pick the one that will produce the least adverse emotional consequences
*   Say aloud to yourself, “Stop!” and shift your attention to something else.
*   Engage in some positive rumination — otherwise known as daydreaming (imagine something positive)
*   Instead of imagining yourself in another positive situation, imagine yourself in the same situation that caused your anger, but without any feelings of anger.
*   Imagine yourself in the same (or different) situation, but feeling a negative emotion other than anger (for example, sadness).
