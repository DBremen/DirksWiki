# Speaking out in anger {#speaking-out-in-anger}

Screaming at someone that he’s a “@#$%head!” communicates nothing but raw anger. It doesn’t tell the person why you’re angry.

**You need to use your anger to educate, inform, and share that part of yourself that is hurt, sad, frustrated, insecure, and feels attacked with the person who tapped into these feelings.**

1.  **Come up with a label to identify the intensity of your anger.**

For example, are you annoyed, irritated, mad, irate, or in a rage? Start by saying, “I feel. . . .” Don’t say, “I think. . . .” What you’re going for here is your feeling, not your thoughts about how unpleasant the other person was.

1.  **Identify what really triggered your anger in the first place**
2.  **Ask yourself what it would take to help you return to a non-angry state.**

For example, “I would appreciate it if he would ask his friends to leave when I get home from work so we can have some one-on-one time.”

When you’re able to go through these three steps inside your head, see if you can actually have that conversation with the person you’re angry with.

When speaking up in anger keep it short.

It is not what you say; it is how you say it:

*   Keep pace slow and volume low
