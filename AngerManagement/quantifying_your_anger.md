# Quantifying your anger {#quantifying-your-anger}

Anger, is not the same as:

**Hostility:** An attitude of ill will synonymous with cynicism, mistrust, and paranoia

**Aggression or violence**: Various types of behavior that are always intended to inflict harm on others

**How often do you get angry (episodic or chronic) and how intense is your anger on a scale from 1-10 (mild – extreme)?**

*   **1 - 3 = irritability, annoyed**
*   **4 - 6 = anger**
*   **7 – 10 = rage**

**Anger is in the eye of the beholder. It’s not the things that happen to you that make you angry as much as it is the way you respond to those things.**
