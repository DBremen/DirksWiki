## Take immediate action {#take-immediate-action}

Anger, by its very nature, is meant to be short lived. It comes and it goes like a wave hitting the beach. For most people, anger is over within five to ten minutes.

How do you settle for just being annoyed?

*   Don’t think of the incident or situation as more serious than it is
*   Don’t take it personally
*   Don’t blame the other person
*   Don’t think about revenge
*   Keep striving for a non-angry way of coping with the situation
    *   Listen to nice music
    *   Think about something pleasant
*   Take some type of action to adjust to or correct the annoying situation.
