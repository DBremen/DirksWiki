*   **Cynicism**
*   **Everything is a catastrophe**
*   **Everything in life is either black or white**
*   **It’s all about me**

You’re always asking the same question over and over: “Why aren’t they treating me fairly?”

The question you should be asking is: “**Why do I get so angry whenever I don’t get what I want when I want it?”** Anger is like a mirror — your own personal mirror. Look into it and see what comes back at you. Maybe you’re spoiled or you’re a bit grandiose in what you expect of yourself and others at work. Maybe they’re not the problem — maybe you are.

Look around at the other people you work with. **Are they as angry at work as you are? If not, and if they’re doing the same work, you should ask yourself why. Why are you angry and they’re not?**

**All that anger that you’re spewing out over the years can rob your family of energy, make them ill, and ruin their careers as well.**
