# Exponent rules: {#exponent-rules}

Base, Exponent. Raising the base to the the x<sup>th </sup> Power.

Kehrwert = reciprocal

Taking the square root of a number results in two possible answers—a positive

answer and a negative answer. Taking the radical of a number results in just

the positive square root of the number.

“Cubing” something means you raise it to the third power, or multiply it by itself three times.

The square root of a negative number is not on a number line, but the

concept is so useful in science that we deﬁne the square root of -1 as the

letter i. The number i is an imaginary number, and anything multiplied by

i is also an imaginary number.
