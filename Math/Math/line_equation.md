# Line equation: {#line-equation}

The slope of a line is the ratio of the vertical change to the horizontal change as we move from one point on a line to another point.

**Y=mx+b (slope*x + y intercept) slope**=m ==

**(5,2) (3,5)** (x,y) = = 3 points down = 2 points to the right y=-

**B=y intercept**

y=- insert one of the points for x and y=

**y=**

If the slope is downwards (upper left to down right)

Then the coefficient is negative y=-2x+2 (3=coefficient and 2=y axis intercept)

**In general, any equation of the form , where A, B, and C are constants (A and B not both zero) and x and y are variables, is a linear equation in two variables, and its graph is a straight line.**

**The statement “any equation of the form Ax + By = C” technically means “any equation of the form Ax + By = C or equivalent to the form.” For example, the equation y = x + 3, which has a straight line graph, is equivalent to - x + y = 3.**

**The knowledge that any equation of the form Ax + By = C produces a straight line graph, along with the fact that two points determine a straight line, makes graphing linear equations in two variables a simple process. We merely find two solutions, plot the corresponding points, and connect the points with a straight line. It is probably wise to find a third point as a check point.**

**Point slope form**

**M=slope**

**Systems of equations:**

9x – 4y= -78

4x + y = -18

When drawing both equations as a graph the solution of both equations would be the intersection of those lines since it represents a point that satisfies both equations.

Solve by x:

Make coefficient of y equal by multiplying by 4 (in case if that is not possible multiply each to have a coefficient that is a common multiple)

4x + y = -18 | *4 16x + 4y = -72

9x – 4y = -18

------------------

25x = -150 | /25

X = -6

Set in variable:

4 -* -6 + y=-18 = -24+y=-18 y=24-18=6 **(-6,6)**

Systems of two linear equations

Suppose we graph x - 2y = 4 and x + 2y = 8 on the same set of axes. The ordered pair (6, 1), which is associated with the point of intersection of the two lines, satisfies both equations. In other words, we say that (6, 1) is the solution for x - 2y = 4 and x + 2y = 8.

1.  To solve a system of linear equations by graphing, we proceed as in the opening discussion of this section. We graph the equations on the same set of axes, and then the ordered pairs associated with any points of intersection are the solutions to the system.
