## Least common multiple {#least-common-multiple}

The least common multiple (LCM) is the smallest nonzero common multiple of each number. Prime factor each number and select each factor the most number of times it appears in the factorizations.

### Find the least common multiple of 48 and 84. {#find-the-least-common-multiple-of-48-and-84}

Solution

We need four 2s in the least common multiple because of the four 2s in 48\. We need one 3 because of the 3 in each of the numbers, and one 7 is needed because of the 7 in 84\. The least common multiple of 48 and 84 is 2*2*2*2*3*7=336

84 = 2 *2 * 3 *7

48=2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 3

FOIL (First Outside Inside Last)

(a + b)(c + d) = (First of 1<sup>st</sup> set * First of 2<sup>nd</sup> set) + (Outside of 1<sup>st</sup> set * Outside of 2<sup>nd</sup> set) + (Inside of 1<sup>st</sup> set * Inside of 2<sup>nd</sup> set) + (Last of 1<sup>st</sup> set * Last of 2<sup>nd</sup> set)

(a + b)(c + d) = ac + ad + bc + bd.
