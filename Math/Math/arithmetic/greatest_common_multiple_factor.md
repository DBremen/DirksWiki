## Greatest common multiple (factor) {#greatest-common-multiple-factor}

_The greatest common factor (GCF) of two numbers is the largest divisor of both numbers. Prime factor each number and select each common factor the least number of times it appears in the factorizations._

### Find the greatest common factor of 48 and 60. {#find-the-greatest-common-factor-of-48-and-60}

Since two 2s and one 3 are common to both, the greatest common factor of 48 and 60 is 12

48 = 4*12= 2*2*2*2*3

60=5*12=5*2*2*3

### Find the greatest common factor of 24, 56, and 120. {#find-the-greatest-common-factor-of-24-56-and-120}

Since three 2s are common to the numbers, the greatest common factor of 24, 56, and 120 is 8

120 = 30*4=6*5*4= 2 * 2 * 2 * 3 * 5

24 = 2 * 2 * 2 * 3

56= 2 * 2 * 2 * 7
