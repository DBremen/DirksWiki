**Rule of Sum:** if a first task can be done in m ways, while a second task can be done in n ways, and the 2<sup>nd</sup> task can not to be done simultaneously, then performing either task can be accomplished in any one of m+n ways. (m and n are assumed to be distinct)

**Rule of Product:** If a procedure can be broken down into 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> stages, and there are m possible outcomes for the 1<sup>st</sup> stand and n possible outcomes for the 2<sup>nd</sup> stage, then we can carry out the procedure in **mn ways.**

**Example:** Casting for a movie where a couple is required. With 5 men and 6 women, how many ways can the director cast the couple.

5*6 = 30 ways.
