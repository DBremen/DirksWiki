# Odds {#odds}

To **convert** from a **probability to odds**, divide the **probability** by one minus that **probability**. So if the **probability** is 10% or 0.10 , then the **odds** are 0.1/0.9 or &#039;1 to 9&#039; or 0.111\. To **convert** from **odds** to a **probability**, divide the **odds** by one plus the **odds**.

Odds to probability

1:4 = 1/(4+1) : 4/(4+1) = 20%:80%

Probability to odds

20%:80% = 1: .8/.2 = 1:4

### Cookie Problem using odds {#cookie-problem-using-odds}

There are two bowls of cookies:

Bowl 1: 30 vanilla and 10 chocolate cookies

Bowl 2: 20 vanilla and 20 chocolate cookies

Now suppose you choose one of the bowls at random and, without looking, select a cookie at random. The cookie is vanilla.

*   The prior probability p(bowl 1) is 50%, so the prior odds are 1 : 1, or just 1\.
*   The likelihoods for vanilla in each bowl are:
    *   Bowl1 30 : 10 = 30/40 or ¾
    *   Bowl2 : 20: 20= 20/40 or ½
*   Likelihood ratio = ¾ / ½ = 3/2
*   Posterior odds = 3 : 2 = 3/5 in probability (60%)
