## Rolling dice {#rolling-dice}

When rolling two die there are 6<sup>2</sup> = 36 possible outcomes (order does matter, 1-2 is different to 2-1)

There is only way that the sum if the die will be two therefore the probability of such an outcome is 1/36

There are 2 ways adding up to 3: 1-2, 1-1 with probability 2/36

6<sup>3</sup> = 216 = probability = 27/216

= all outcomes – all that are between 1-5

= 6<sup>3 </sup> – 5<sup>3</sup> = 91

Number of places = 5 choose 2 = 10

Number of ways filing in the remaining places = 5<sup>3</sup> = 125

Probability = 10*125/6<sup>5</sup>

Number of places to put two 1s= 5 choose 2 = 10

Number of ways filing in the remaining places

*   3 ways to put a 6
*   + 4<sup>2</sup>

10*3*4<sup>2</sup>/6<sup>5</sup>

To calculate the probability of two or more independent events, we multiply the probabilities of the

individual events.
