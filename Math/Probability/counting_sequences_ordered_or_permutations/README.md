# Counting sequences (ordered) or permutations {#counting-sequences-ordered-or-permutations}

How many numbers are in 1..10?

1..n = n

How many numbers are in 5..56?

Subtract 4 from every number to get 1..52 = 52

k..n = n â€“ (k -1) = n-k+1

How many numbers between 23 and 283 are divisible by 5?

25..280 (only include first and last number divisible within the range)

25/5..280/5 = 5..56 (divide first and last number by five)

5-4..56-4 = 52 numbers (subtract k-1)

5000 * 10 * 365 * 400

2,000,000000 * 7.3
