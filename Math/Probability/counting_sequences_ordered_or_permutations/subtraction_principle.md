## Subtraction principle {#subtraction-principle}

e.g. # of consonants in alphabet = 26 – # of vowels.

**How many four letter words (with repetition) contain at least one vowel?**

# four letter words = 26<sup>4</sup>

Count the number of 4 letter words that contain only consonants and subtract it from all four letter words.

= 21<sup>4</sup>

26<sup>4</sup> – 21<sup>4</sup>

# between 23..283 = 283 – 22 = 261

# divisible by 5 between 23..283 = 25..280 /5 = 5..56 = 56-4 = 52

# between 23..283 and not divisible by 5 = 261-52 = 209

# of ways = 10!

Subtraction principle:

10! - # ways we can line up the class so that Donald and Marco ARE adjacent

# ways we can line up the class so that Donald and Marco ARE adjacent = #ways we can put them adjacent * 8!

# adjacent ways =

*   if one of them is either in front or back there is only 1 way to put them adjacent = 2
*   in any other of the 8 places there are two places where they can be adjacent = 8 * 2

10! – (8! * 18)

# between 5..85 = 81

# between 5..85 divisible by 2 = 6..84 = 84/2 = 3..42 = 40

# between 5..85 divisible by 3 = 6..84 = 84/3 = 2..28 = 27

# that are divisible by 2 and 3 = numbers divisible by 6 = 6..84 = 1..14

81 – (40 + 27 - 14) = 28
