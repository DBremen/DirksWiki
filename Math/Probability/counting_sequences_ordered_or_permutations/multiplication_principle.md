### With repitition {#with-repitition}

How many combos can you make out of 3 pairs of shoes 7 tops and 2 pants =

3 * 7 * 2 = 42

If the choices are without removal powers can be used.

How many 5 letter combinations can be made out of the alphabet?

First letter = 26; second letter = 26 possibilities…

26<sup>5</sup>

### w/o repetition (unique, permutations) {#w-o-repetition-unique-permutations}

w/o repetition means that once an object is chosen it can’t be chosen again (e.g. a ball is not returned to its urn)

How many ways are there when assigning president, vice president, secretary and treasurer for a class of 15 students (one person can have just one of the roles)

15 -&gt; president

14 -&gt; vice president

13 -&gt; secretary

12 -&gt; treasurer

15*14*13*12

Permut(15,4)

Fact(15)/Fact(11)

Number of sequences of k objects chosen without repetition from a collection of n objects:

The denominator removes the factors that we don’t want e.g.:

1*2*…*15/1*2*..11 = 12*13*14*15

9 * 8 *7 = 504

Here the choices we make for the first two digits affect the number of choices we have at the third stage. But the problem can be worked out if we choose the last digit first:

3\. digit = any of 1,3,5,7,9 = 5

2\. digit = any of 1 to 9 -1 = 8

3\. digit = any of 1 to 9 -2 = 7

= 5*8*7

Sequence must start with a boy and alternate between sexes:

1.  8
2.  7
3.  7

…

1.  1
2.  1

Or 8! * 7!
