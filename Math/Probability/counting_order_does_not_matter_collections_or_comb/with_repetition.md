## With repetition {#with-repetition}

The dining hall offers eight varieties of fruit, conveniently labelled A, B, and so on, up to H. You&#039;re feeling hungry so you&#039;ve decided to get five servings of fruit. Not necessarily five different fruits, but a total of five servings. And the question, of course, is the usual, how many different snacks could you choose?

The first rule is, each serving of fruit has to be on its own tray. (5 trays)

Second, there have to be empty or divider trays-one between the trays containing apples and the trays containing bananas. One between the trays containing bananas and the trays containing cantaloupes, and so. In other words, Calvin needs seven empty trays marked, for example, A to B, B to C, C to D, and so on. He needs these trays to be there, even if he&#039;s not getting any of the fruits in questions. (7 empty trays).

Answer: 12 choose 7
