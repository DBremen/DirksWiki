## w/o repetition {#w-o-repetition}

The number of ways of choosing a collection of k objects without repetition from a set of n objects

The number of sequences (ordered) is given by: 15*14*13*12*11 or n!/(n-k)! or 15!/10!

N = total number of collections

For each collection of 5 students there are 5! Sequences to line them up.

The number of sequences can also be expressed as N * 5!

Therefore N * 5! = 15!/10!

Solving for N:

Choose 5 from 15

Choose 3 from 6

Combin(6,3)

6!/(3!*3!)

The number of ways of choosing a collection of k objects without repetition from a set of n objects

Quotient of factorials = binomial coefficient

N choose K

10 choose 3 = 10 choose 7

10! / 7! * 3! = 10! / 3! * 7!

Because every time you choose k objects, and you take them away from the set n, the n minus k objects remain and give you a collection of n minus k objects. So every time you have a set of k objects, you also have a set of n minus k objects.

Divide into hands that contain ace of spades and don’t

52 choose 5 = hands in poker game = 52! / (47! * 5!) = 52*51*50*49*48 / 1*2*3*4*5

51! / (46! * 5!) = 51*50*49*48*47 / 1*2*3*4*5

51! / (47! *4!) = 51*50*49*48 / 1*2*3*4~~*5 (~~47-52= 5)

Divide into hands that contain ace of spades and don’t

Hands that don’t contain ace of spades = 52-1 choose 5

Hands that do contain ace of spades = 52-1 choose 5-1

Meat = 7 choose 2 = 7!/5!*2! = 7*6/2 = 21

Veg. = 6 choose 2 = 6!/4!*2! = 6*5/2 = 15

Overall = 21*15 = 315

Overall options = 13 choose 4 = 715 (315 is a subset of that)

### Multinomials {#multinomials}

Let&#039;s say you&#039;re one of a group of 9 students, and you decided as a group that you want to live together in a dorm on campus. You&#039;re in luck. The dorm has available a double, a triple, and a quad. That is suites that hold 2, 3, and 4 students. So the 9 of you will just fit.

1.  Way = 9 choose 4 * 5 choose 3 = 1260
2.  Way = 9 choose 2 * 7 choose 3 = 1260

9!/(4!*3!*2!) = 1260

Both ways are equivalent and a formula can be generalized as:

Suppose we have a pool of n objects and we want to divide them up into k collections of sizes a1, a2, a3, and so on up to ak. **Notice that for this to make sense, the numbers a1 through ak have to add up to n.**

**Simplified:**

**Multinomial coefficient**

### Anagrams {#anagrams}

Since there are duplicate letters the multiplication rule (7*6*…) doesn’t work.

We want to divide up the pool of 7 slots into 4 collections:

*   one collection of 3 slots, which will get the E&#039;s
*   one collection of 2 slots, these get the S&#039;s
*   and two collections of 1 each that get the C and the H.

7!/(3!*2!*1!*1!) = 4*5*6*7/2 = 420
