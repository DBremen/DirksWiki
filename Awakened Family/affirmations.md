# Affirmations {#affirmations}

I fully accept that parenting is about raising myself, not my child.

Instead of:

*   Seeing a child, I will see a spiritual being.
*   Holding my child to my standards, I will help them create their own.
*   Holding them in dependency, I will liberate them to autonomy.
*   Treating them as “mine,” I will help them to be themselves.
*   Obsessing over conformity, perfect behavior, and outward appearances, I will encourage genuineness in my child.
*   Praising compliance, I will praise the courage to be authentic.

_Open the Heart_

**Allow** the image of your child’s face when they sleep to enter your heart. Feel your heart opening. Enter this well of warmth. From this place, share yourself with your child.

**Remember **when your child was sick or in the ER or hospital? Or remember when another child you knew was ill or suffering? How everything that you thought was important suddenly wasn’t? All these thoughts make you realize how blessed you are right here, right now. From this place go to your child and let them know what they mean to you.

**Savor** your child’s moods, sulks, and tantrums. They are children for only a short time. Embrace their tears, fears, yells, and falls. Childhood doesn’t last forever.

_Enter Presence_

**Detach** from the urge to ask your child a single question today. Simply observe and follow their lead.

**Allow **your child to enter your embrace without any words or judgment, just heart-to-heart connection.

**Create** the space for your children to “be” today. Watch them as they unfold into themselves. Notice their body language. Try to connect to their feelings beneath the words. Do the same for yourself.

_Enter a No-Judgment Zone_

**Commit** to being judgment-free today, no matter what the triggers.

**Be curious. **Don’t make statements out of impatient judgment.

**Pause** and take a step back. Before you react with judgment, ask, “Does this really matter in the long run?”

_Express Feelings Safely_

**Open** conversations with observations, not questions; with comfort, not control.

**Invite **your children to talk to you by letting them know they don’t have to talk at all.

**Validate** them to feel exactly what they feel at any given moment.

_Let Them Lead_

**Empower** your child to create their own schedule today, and you be their assistant.

**Harness** your child’s inner guide by allowing them to make decisions for the family appropriate to their maturity.

**Hand over the reins** of your child’s unstructured time to them. Let them govern themselves today.

_Be Spontaneous in Play_

**Drop** what you are doing and join your child in whatever they are doing—be it on their iPad, on their computer, or doing homework. Just sit by them and enter their world for a little while.

**Invite** your child to choose one game or to lead in any one activity—baking a cake, making cookies, gluing pictures, taking a walk, throwing a ball—of their choosing that doesn’t involve a screen. Just for fifteen to thirty minutes. Be present through it all.

**Be attentive **for a moment to laugh with them, be it over a joke, a memory, or a riddle. Create the glue of laughter and good times, knowing that these will last lifetimes.
