## Example of conscious reacting {#example-of-conscious-reacting}

**“Is my child in some way reflecting the way I tend to operate? Are there ways I need to restructure my life so I can be more organized?”**

**Am I trying to protect my child from making the same failure that I made?**

**Am I authentic?**

**Am I controlling my emotions or am I throwing a tantrum?**

**When we ignore the immature ways we sometimes behave toward our children, by making use of the “power” we have over them, which they consistently reflect back to us, we turn down one of the most profound opportunities to grow ourselves up.**
