## Clash of time zones {#clash-of-time-zones}

Don’t focus on planning, doing and keeping them busy for the sake of it. Parents are oriented to the future, to getting to wherever they imagine themselves to be going. Children, on the other hand, when left to themselves inhabit the present. Most of the disconnection between parent and child comes down to this rupture between a life enjoyed moment by moment and a life that’s focused on moving ahead.

**When children feel seen, believe they are worthy, and discern that they matter for who they are as a person and not just because of what they accomplish, they are able to enjoy their own sense of empowerment.**

I now realize how I had it wrong,

Upside down and outside in,

It is you who is there

to wake me up to my true self.
