## Feelings vs emotions {#feelings-vs-emotions}

People often confuse emotions with feelings, as if the two were the same. I look at them as vastly different. Simply put, we react with an emotion when we are unable to handle our feelings.

When we feel our feelings, we don’t have time to engage in reactive emotions. We tune in and allow the feelings to speak to us, wash over us, and transform us. Aware that we are under waves of feeling, we do the opposite of emoting. We hush up, become still, and allow the significance of the feelings to grow us up.

_“I have had a long day and am tired. I have no energy left and need to rest. This is why I am beginning to sound impatient and can barely hold it together. Can you please help me out here? “_

**“Why do clothes on the floor affect my inner sense of stability? Why do I feel personally threatened to the point of lashing out at my child?”**

**Consumed with a mythical standard of “how things should be,” we often feel we have no choice but to react. We are compelled. However, by examining each reaction and identifying which myth is driving it (and often it’s more than one), we can begin to tame our reactivity. All that’s required is to observe what we tell ourselves in such situations. This enables us to recognize which cultural myth or myths we are in the clutches of.**

**Feeling:** You feel impatient with your child for being too slow. You feel helpless, frustrated, and incompetent.

**Reaction:** You want to push them along, perhaps even yell at them.

Entering the fear: Notice that you have been triggered. This is a red light, a warning to halt. Hit your internal freeze button.

Notice your agitation, take a deep breath, then allow yourself to become quiet internally. If necessary, leave the room. Examine your fear by asking:

*   What’s the nature of the fear I’m experiencing?
*   What am I afraid will happen?
*   Is that really such a bad thing?
*   Will it be the end of the world?
*   Can I own that my fear stems from my past?
*   Can I see that it has nothing to do with my child?
*   Can I allow the feeling to pass through me and tap into a deeper trust?
