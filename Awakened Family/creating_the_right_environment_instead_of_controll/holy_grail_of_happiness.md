## Holy grail of happiness {#holy-grail-of-happiness}

In the search for eternal happiness we don’t realize that this means we are conditioned to depend on life working out in a particular way, we appear helpless when it doesn’t. Only when we separate the internal (ourselves) from the external (things that happen in life) do we realize that who we are internally can continue to adjust, and in fact flourish, despite our external situation.

The challenge is to see the pleasure and the pain of life equal in terms of the opportunity they present us. If we approached life this way, and showed our children how to do so, we would stop searching for happiness, knowing that the process of engaging whatever comes our way holds the greatest fulfillment.

To understand true happiness, we need only to observe young children. hey don’t wait to be happy until they are rich, thin, pretty, or in the “right” social circle.
