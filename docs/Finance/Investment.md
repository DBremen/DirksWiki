A stock is technically a loan with inﬁnite maturity, so the company
won't actually ever pay back the loan. In reality, most companies come
to an end eventually, but there are many companies that have lasted for
100 years or more. Furthermore, a stock may not ever pay out any cash
dividends at all, so you may not get any interest on the loan either.

**Short selling:** an investor borrows securities, sells the borrowed
securities immediately, and then hopes to buy them back later at a lower
price. Investors borrow securities when they believe that their value
will fall.

Dividend discount model
-----------------------

-   The cash ﬂows that investors receive from stock are the dividends,
    so fundamentals-based models of stock price note that the current
    price of a share of stock is equal to the present discounted value
    of the sum of all its future dividends. Technically, this represents
    an inﬁnite number of future dividends.

-   There's a surprisingly simple formula for the present value of the
    sum of all future dividends: D/(r − g). This formula is called the
    dividend discount model.

    -   the amount of the next annual dividend: D = \$1.72 per share

    -   the expected return on the stock (based on CAPM): r

        -   To use the CAPM to estimate the expected return, or discount
            rate, on a stock, we use the following formula:

        -   ![](C:\scripts\dirkswiki\docs\Finance\media_Investment/media/image1.png)![](C:\scripts\dirkswiki\docs\Finance\media_Investment/media/image2.png)

        -   E(r~i~) = expected return

        -   r~f~ = risk-free-rate = return on a 10-year treasury bond
            (about 5%)

        -   ß~i~ = beta

        -   The ﬁnal term is the difference between the expected return
            on the entire market and the risk-free rate---called the
            market risk premium, or the compensation for bearing one
            unit of risk.

-   average growth rate of the dividend: g (average dividend growth rate
    over the past 5 years.)

Dividends
---------

Companies usually don't reduce the relative amount of dividends
(dividend yield) the pay but rather try to keep them stable or even
increase. Reducing or increasing dividends is an indicator of strength
or weakness.

Several academic studies show that the higher the fraction of earnings a
company pays out as dividends, the higher the growth rate of earnings
tends to be over the next 10 years.

A **stock buyback, or share repurchase**, is a transaction in which a
company goes into the stock market and repurchases, or buys back, some
of its outstanding shares. This is a **substitute for a dividend**
because the company has to pay cash for these repurchased shares, which
returns cash to the company's shareholders.
