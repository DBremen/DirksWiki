There are some really nice things in life that naturally reinforce each
other, and in doing so, they form virtuous cycles with each other. For
example, if you enjoy performing an activity that requires some level of
skill, you may find yourself doing it a lot and getting better at it.
And as you get better at it, you may derive even more enjoyment from it.
And when you enjoy it more, you do it even more and get even better at
it, and so on. So in this case, skillfulness and enjoyment form a
virtuous cycle in which one strengthens the other---hence you end up
benefiting from both at once, at no extra cost.

Joy and meditation are another pair of really nice things that form a
virtuous cycle with each other. Meditation is training of the mind. Joy
becomes highly accessible in a trained mind. With training, the mind
learns to access inner joy with increasing ease and frequency. At the
same time, the joyful mind is at peace, a peaceful mind is easily
focused, and a focused mind becomes more trainable, thereby making
meditation practice even more effective. Thus a virtuous and joyful
cycle forms. Once you put it into motion, the meditation practice that
perhaps you thought you'd never have can be sustained, and joy becomes a
dominant factor in daily life.

Habit
=====

A habit is a loop that consists of three parts: a cue, a routine, and a
reward.[^7^](9780062378941_Notes.xhtml#ch2en7) The cue is something that
activates the habit---it leads to the routine. The routine is the
behavior itself---it leads to the reward. The reward is the perceived
benefit that comes from doing the behavior, and it reinforces the habit
so that the next occurrence of the same cue is more likely to
automatically activate the routine. Thus a loop forms.

**INFORMAL PRACTICE: CREATING A HABIT OF TAKING MINDFUL BREATHS**

Choose a cue, something that, when it occurs, activates the habit of
taking a mindful breath. The cue I most highly recommend is any
situation when you have to wait.

Whenever the cue occurs, take one slow, deep breath and bring some
amount of attention to that breath. For safety reasons (for example, if
you're walking or driving), you may need to maintain an appropriate
amount of attention to your surroundings as you pay some attention to
your breath.

If taking that mindful breath makes you feel any better, simply notice
that. It will be the reward that reinforces the habit.

Meditation is not about not thinking
====================================

One of the biggest misconceptions about meditation is that it involves
"emptying your mind of all thoughts." This one misconception is more
responsible for turning people away from meditation than any other that
I know of. Meditation is about allowing the mind to settle on its own
terms, in its own time, which includes allowing thoughts to arise as and
when they want to. It is true that over time, with practice, as the mind
becomes more deeply settled, the stream of thoughts slows down and
eventually goes from being like a raging waterfall to being like a
fast-flowing river, then more like a slow-flowing stream, and finally,
the mind is like a placid lake. Over time (in my own case, after many,
many hours of meditation practice), the mind learns to quiet down on
demand, but that does not come from suppressing the process of
thinking---instead, it comes from learning to give the mind the space
and time to settle on its own terms. Meditation is not what you think,
or not think.

A skillful meditator periodically does three things: periodically he
arouses mental energy, periodically he calms the mind, and periodically
he watches the mind with equanimity. Simply put, skillfully managing
energy in meditation boils down to balancing three mental
factors: **mental relaxation, mental energy,** and **equanimous
watching.**

Easing into joy
===============

Resting the mind to put it into a state of ease. Being joyful at rest,
no ego stroking or sensual pleasure required. Cultivating this form of
inner joy begins to free us from overreliance on sense and ego
stimulation for pleasure. This means joy becomes increasingly available
anyplace, anytime.

**Whenever there is any experience of joy,\
just notice it. That is all.**

**FORMAL PRACTICE: NOTICING JOY IN ONE BREATH**

Do the One Mindful Breath exercise from Chapter 2, which is simply to
take one deep breath mindfully. If any hint of joy arises anytime during
the exercise, **simply notice it,** that is all. If no hint of joy
arises, no problem either; we simply **notice the absence** of joy.

Inclining the mind toward joy
=============================

Next, we learn to notice joy and give it our full attention. We learn
where to look in order to see and appreciate joy that is already
available to us, in moments that we hadn't noticed before. The more the
mind becomes familiar with joy, the more it perceives joy, inclines
toward joy, and effortlessly creates the conditions conducive to joy.

**FORMAL PRACTICE: INVITING AND ATTENDING TO JOY**

Sit in any posture that allows you to be alert and relaxed at the same
time, whatever that means to you. You may keep your eyes open or closed.

Let us take three breaths. In the first breath, bring gentle but intense
attention to the process of breathing. In the second breath, calm the
body. In the third breath, bring up joy. If necessary, bring up a smile
or a half smile, whatever the words *half smile* mean to you. If any joy
arises, bring full attention to it. If you like, repeat this
three-breaths practice a few more times.

Uplifting the mind
==================

Here, we learn to uplift the mind with wholesome joy, especially joy
arising from goodness, generosity, loving-kindness, and compassion. The
wholesomeness of such joy benefits mental health the same way wholesome
food benefits physical health.

**INFORMAL PRACTICE: ATTENDING TO THE JOY OF PLEASANT DAILY
EXPERIENCES**

Whenever you engage in an activity that involves a pleasant experience,
take at least one moment to attend fully to the joy that pleasantness
invokes. Some examples:

> At each meal, attend fully to the enjoyment of at least the first
> bite.
>
> When seeing a loved one, especially a beloved child, take one moment
> to appreciate that he or she is there, and attend fully to that joy.
>
> When holding hands with a loved one, take one moment to attend fully
> to the joy of that contact.
>
> When taking a shower, attend fully to at least one moment of the
> enjoyment of the body's contact with water.
>
> When relieving yourself in the toilet, attend fully to at least one
> moment of the pleasure of relief.
>
> When out on a nice day, take one moment to attend fully to the
> enjoyment of the weather.
>
> When walking, take one moment to attend fully to the joy of being able
> to walk.
>
> In general, when seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, or touching
> something pleasant, bring full attention to the joy for at least one
> moment, and when interacting with a beloved person, bring full
> attention to the joy of being with that person for at least one
> moment.

**INFORMAL PRACTICE: AWARENESS OF MORTALITY**

At least once a day, either in the morning shortly after waking up or in
the evening shortly before sleep, or anytime in the day, remind yourself
of these two things:

•Someday, I will die. I will die. Every moment I have is precious.

•Someday, every single person I love dearly will die. They will all die.
Every moment I have with them is precious.

**INFORMAL PRACTICE: NOTICING THE ABSENCE OF PAIN**

Periodically, perhaps once a day, perhaps more frequently, bring
awareness to the body to see if there is any experience of pain. Do you
have a headache, a toothache, neck pain, back pain, or a stomachache? If
any of those parts of the body is not in pain, you may remind yourself,
"I do not have a headache / toothache / neck pain, etc., right now." If
any joy arises due to that thought, bring attention to that joy.

Periodically, perhaps once a day, perhaps more frequently, bring
awareness to the mind to see if there is any experience of mental or
emotional pain. Are you experiencing the pain of grief, sorrow, hatred,
anger, jealousy, envy, want, grasping, fear, or desperation? If you are
not experiencing any of those sources of pain right now, you may remind
yourself, "I am not afflicted by the pain of grief / sorrow / hatred,
etc., right now." If any joy arises due to that thought, bring attention
to that joy.

**FORMAL PRACTICE: JUST NOTE GONE**

Sit in any posture that allows you to be alert and relaxed at the same
time, whatever that means to you. You may keep your eyes open or closed.

Sit in meditation for as many minutes as you like. Apply intense
attention to the end of every out breath, clearly seeing the moment it
ends. At the end of an out breath, if you like, you may silently note to
yourself, "Gone."

If any thought or sensation arises, see if you can watch it until it
fades away. If it ceases at any time, even if for one moment, note its
cessation. If you like, you may silently note to yourself, "Gone."

You may end this meditation at any time. At the moment the meditation
ends, take note of its ending. If you like, you may silently note to
yourself, "Gone."

**INFORMAL PRACTICE: WISHING FOR RANDOM PEOPLE TO BE HAPPY**

During working hours or school hours, randomly identify two people who
walk past you or who are standing or sitting around you. Secretly wish
for them to be happy. Just think to yourself, "I wish for this person to
be happy, and I wish for that person to be happy." That is the entire
practice. Don't do anything; don't say anything; just think. This is
entirely a thinking exercise.

If you prefer, you can do this at any time of the day for any amount of
time. You can also do it at any other place. If there is nobody present,
you can bring someone to mind for the purpose of this exercise.

If you like, you may pretend you are firing a "happiness ray gun" at
them and make "pew, pew" sound effects in your head. Batteries not
required.

**FORMAL PRACTICE: ATTENDING TO THE JOY OF LOVING-KINDNESS**

Sit in any posture that allows you to be alert and relaxed at the same
time, whatever that means to you. You may keep your eyes open or closed.

Repeat this cycle once per minute: Bring to mind someone for whom you
can very easily feel loving-kindness. Wish for him or her to be happy.
The joy of loving-kindness may arise, and if that happens, bring full
attention to the joy until it fades away. For the rest of the minute,
just rest the mind.

When the next minute begins, start the cycle again, for a total of three
minutes.
