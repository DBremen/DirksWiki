**Anger management is really all about mind over matter.** It's about
giving yourself adequate time to respond to your feelings, asking the
right questions about your anger, choosing how to respond when you get
mad, and deciding if you're willing to pay the consequences for
outrageous behavior.

**Just because you have the right to be angry doesn't mean you have to
exercise that right!**

-   **Acknowledge your anger as soon as you experience it.**

-   **Use your anger to better understand yourself.**

-   **Express your anger without venting**

-   **Stop saying you're "fine" when you're not.**

-   **Confess your anger on a daily basis.**

-   **Think of anger as your ally rather than your enemy.**

-   **Find healthy ways --- like exercise --- to let off steam.**

-   **Think of anger as a legitimate emotion just like love and joy.**

-   **Start saying "Excuse you!" to people who treat you badly.**

-   **Let yourself off the hook by forgiving others.**

-   **Live in the present, not the past.**

-   **Forgo reciprocity --- there's no such thing as getting even.**

-   **Come back and discuss the reasons for your anger after you walk
    away.**

**Anger is neither bad nor good**

Anger serves a variety of positive purposes when it comes to coping with
stress. It energizes you, improves your communication with other people,
promotes your self-esteem, and defends you against fear and insecurity.
(Jesus, Gandhi, and Martin Luther King, Jr., were all angry men --- but
they turned that anger into social reform that made the world a better
place.)

When it leads to domestic violence, property damage, sexual abuse, drug
addiction, ulcers, and self-mutilation, anger is definitely not good.

**You want to have emotions but you want to be in control of those
emotions.**

Quantifying your anger
======================

Anger, is not the same as:

**Hostility:** An attitude of ill will synonymous with cynicism,
mistrust, and paranoia

**Aggression or violence**: Various types of behavior that are always
intended to inflict harm on others

**How often do you get angry (episodic or chronic) and how intense is
your anger on a scale from 1-10 (mild -- extreme)?**

-   **1 - 3 = irritability, annoyed**

-   **4 - 6 = anger**

-   **7 -- 10 = rage**

**Anger is in the eye of the beholder. It's not the things that happen
to you that make you angry as much as it is the way you respond to those
things.**

Views that emphasize anger:
===========================

-   **Cynicism**

-   **Everything is a catastrophe**

-   **Everything in life is either black or white**

-   **It's all about me**

You're always asking the same question over and over: "Why aren't they
treating me fairly?"

The question you should be asking is: "**Why do I get so angry whenever
I don't get what I want when I want it?"** Anger is like a mirror ---
your own personal mirror. Look into it and see what comes back at you.
Maybe you're spoiled or you're a bit grandiose in what you expect of
yourself and others at work. Maybe they're not the problem --- maybe you
are.

Look around at the other people you work with. **Are they as angry at
work as you are? If not, and if they're doing the same work, you should
ask yourself why. Why are you angry and they're not?**

**All that anger that you're spewing out over the years can rob your
family of energy, make them ill, and ruin their careers as well.**

Managing your anger today 
==========================

Take immediate action
---------------------

Anger, by its very nature, is meant to be short lived. It comes and it
goes like a wave hitting the beach. For most people, anger is over
within five to ten minutes.

How do you settle for just being annoyed?

-   Don't think of the incident or situation as more serious than it is

-   Don't take it personally

-   Don't blame the other person

-   Don't think about revenge

-   Keep striving for a non-angry way of coping with the situation

    -   Listen to nice music

    -   Think about something pleasant

-   Take some type of action to adjust to or correct the annoying
    situation.

Walking away but coming back
============================

This is an alternative for flight or fight. The problem is that neither
of these extreme options helps you manage anger. If you decide to stand
and fight, you need to remain angry long enough to overcome the threat
--- and the intensity of your anger may become accelerated in the
process. On the other hand, if you retreat from the threat, you end up
taking your angry feelings with you. You can outrun the threat, but not
your own emotions.

You can disengage (walk away) initially ("Excuse me. Give me a minute.
I'll be right back,"), but return later ("Okay, what was it you wanted
to say?"), after you've calmed down sufficiently to discuss how to
resolve the conflict. This is the most mature way to handle
anger-provoking problems, but also the one most people are least likely
to choose.

Stopping the rage
=================

-   Focus on your anger and the reactions to your anger rather than the
    source of your anger

-   Respond rather than react

    -   Your response is predictable (not unpredictable as when you are
        angry)

    -   Thoughtful

    -   Not impulsive

    -   In control

-   Repeat to yourself as many times as necessary, "This too shall
    pass."

-   Breathe

    -   Take a deep, exaggerated breath in through your nose.

    -   Hold the breath for a count of one

    -   Now, exhale in an exaggerated way through your mouth.

    -   Repeat the exercise at least ten times

    -   Think the word release with each exhale. This is your mind's
        command to the body to let go of this unwanted tension. Your
        body will follow the command.

-   Just by being quiet for a few moments, while you continue to
    formulate your response to anger, you'll begin to calm down.

-   Ask yourself 4 questions

    -   Who am I really angry at?

    -   Is this the right time and place to be angry?

    -   Why am I angry?

    -   Is the intensity of my anger consistent with why I'm angry?

-   Come up with other alternatives as to why the other person did what
    she did to trigger your rage

    -   Then pick the one that will produce the least adverse emotional
        consequences

-   Say aloud to yourself, "Stop!" and shift your attention to something
    else.

-   Engage in some positive rumination --- otherwise known as
    daydreaming (imagine something positive)

-   Instead of imagining yourself in another positive situation, imagine
    yourself in the same situation that caused your anger, but without
    any feelings of anger.

-   Imagine yourself in the same (or different) situation, but feeling a
    negative emotion other than anger (for example, sadness).

Speaking out in anger
=====================

Screaming at someone that he's a "@\#\$%head!" communicates nothing but
raw anger. It doesn't tell the person why you're angry.

**You need to use your anger to educate, inform, and share that part of
yourself that is hurt, sad, frustrated, insecure, and feels attacked
with the person who tapped into these feelings.**

1.  **Come up with a label to identify the intensity of your anger.**

    For example, are you annoyed, irritated, mad, irate, or in a rage?
    Start by saying, "I feel. . . ." Don't say, "I think. . . ." What
    you're going for here is your feeling, not your thoughts about how
    unpleasant the other person was.

2.  **Identify what really triggered your anger in the first place**

3.  **Ask yourself what it would take to help you return to a non-angry
    state.**

    For example, "I would appreciate it if he would ask his friends to
    leave when I get home from work so we can have some one-on-one
    time."

When you're able to go through these three steps inside your head, see
if you can actually have that conversation with the person you're angry
with.

When speaking up in anger keep it short.

It is not what you say; it is how you say it:

-   Keep pace slow and volume low

Preventing anger
================

**Anger is the emotion of intolerance. Intolerance means you don't
accept another person's viewpoint or behavior. Anger says that you think
you're right and the other person is wrong. It can't be any simpler than
that.**

Anger defends the listener against any change in his way of thinking.
Instead of accepting the challenge of an honest difference of opinion,
the intolerant person resorts to intimidation, insult, or withdrawal ---
all fueled by anger ---as a way of rigidly holding on to his beliefs.

Instead of being defensive (that's what intolerance is all about!), go
on the offense. Say to the other person, **"Tell me more about that. I'd
like to understand how you arrived at that opinion. This is your chance
to educate me."**

**Look for points of agreement**

**Keep your eyes open and your mouth shut.**

A Zen approach to overcoming anger
==================================

Anger is often an immediate but irrational reaction based on a notion we
have in our heads.

Whether the event is trivial or significant, the cause of anger is
always the same. There is a need that is not being met and that you
expect to be met.

If you can pause to consider what your demand (or need or expectation)
is when you feel anger arising, you will have gone a long way toward
changing it. Whether or not you follow any of the other suggestions in
this book, you will find this simple exercise to be of great value. In
fact, certain types of anger may dissolve with no other effort.

One of the things that you realize when you see the nature of the self
is that what you do and what happens to you are the same thing.
Realizing that you do not exist separately from everything else, you
realize responsibility: You are responsible for everything you
experience. You can no longer say, 'He made me angry.' How could he make
you angry? Only you can make you angry.

When confronted with someone else's anger, use these steps.

1.  Make space before speaking or responding. Take some deep breaths.

2.  Check the face and body of the person in front of you to understand
    what's going on. Observe physiological cues. When a person becomes
    more relaxed, their eyes will be open and they will lean slightly
    toward you.

3.  Consider the consequences of not doing anything---whether something
    that might be helpful in the short run may lead to harm later.

4.  Ask yourself: What assumptions am I making? Ask the person what the
    problem is. Consider your involvement in causing it.

5.  Respect and empathize with both your own boundaries, values, and
    limitations and those of the other person.

    A conflict may be the result of differing values, for instance, two
    family members disagreeing about whether to take care of a parent in
    a nursing facility or at home. One wants safety for her, the other
    wants her happiness. The safety-minded person might come clean and
    admit, "I can't be here all the time; I'm afraid she might hurt
    herself." The other might say, "I would always be upset with myself
    if I didn't support Mother's wishes." Then it becomes an argument
    about concerns instead of positions.

6.  Speak from right attitude. Ask yourself, "What do I really need to
    communicate to this person?" and refrain from venting your feelings
    for other motives.

7.  Deliberately, do not take revenge. In Buddhism, the basic vow is
    benefiting all beings, not everyone except this particular person.

If you don't like what just happened, you have the opportunity to change
the next installment in the soap opera of your life in grand or subtle
ways. Human intelligence gives you the power to react other than by
instinct or habit. Intelligence is the power of choice. Anger cripples
rational thought and therefore limits your choices.

Why we get mad?
===============

Anger is good for you as long as you understand, manage, and use it in
healthy ways. Like all emotions, anger exists in us because it offered
our human and nonhuman ancestors a survival benefit. These brain
structures, facial expressions, and body postures did not happen by
accident. They happened through hundreds of millions of years of our
ancestors surviving hostile forces of nature.

1.  Anger alerts you to injustice.

2.  Anger energizes you to confront injustice.

3.  Anger communicates your status to others.

Anger is, pure and simple, an emotion. It is the feeling state that
arises in us when we have our goals blocked or when we experience an
injustice. Emotions are fundamentally separate from behaviors.

-   Anger is a normal and often healthy response to a variety of
    situations.

-   Anger can be understood, managed, and used in a way that is healthy,
    positive, and prosocial.

-   Anger is an emotion, aggression and violence are
    reactions/behaviours.

    -   People can get afraid seeing people acting aggressively due to
        anger

-   Anger expressions are perceived differently based on the gender,
    race, and other characteristics of the angry person.

-   The consequences of those expressions are very different based on
    the gender, race, and other characteristics of the angry person.

1.  Provocation

    a.  Injustice

    b.  poor treatment

    c.  goal-blocking.

2.  Pre-anger state (tired, hungry,..)

3.  Appraisal (interpretation of the provocation)

    d.  Anger increases if the precipitating source is perceived as
        intentional, preventable, unjustified, and/or blameworthy and
        punishable (i.e., judged as culpable and deserving to suffer).

    e.  primary appraisal -\> judge the precipitant to determine if
        anyone did anything wrong.

    f.  Secondary appraisal -\> decide how bad the situation is and
        whether we can cope with it

        **Was I treated poorly, unfairly, or otherwise wronged?**

        **Is someone or something blocking my goals?**

        **What might I have done to contribute to this?**

Impulse control

Angry thoughts
--------------

-   Overgeneralizing (he/she always does this, why always me?)

-   Demandingness (he/she must do this, I have to do this therefore
    everyone should follow suit, other-directed should)

-   misattributing causation (he/she did it on purpose)

-   catastrophizing

-   **inflammatory labeling** (calling names)
