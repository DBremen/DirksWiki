In each area of my life, did I do those things that are easy to do, and
easy not to do? Did I continue my momentum on the success curve?"

Time is the force that magnifies those simple daily disciplines into
massive success.

There is a natural progression to success: plant, cultivate,
harvest---and the central step, *cultivate,* can only happen over the
course of time.

No genuine success in life is instant. Life is not a clickable link.

To grasp how the slight edge works, you have to view your actions
through the eyes of time.

**Success is not the key to happiness. Happiness is the key to success**

Daily:

-   **Each morning, write down three things you're grateful for.** Not
    the same three every day; find three *new* things to write about.

-   **Journal for two minutes a day about one positive experience you've
    had over the past twenty-four hours.** Write down every detail you
    can remember; this causes your brain to literally reexperience the
    experience, which doubles its positive impact.

    your brain to focus where you want it to, and not get distracted by
    negativity in your environment.

<!-- -->

-   **Do a random act of kindness over the course of each day.** To make
    this simple, Shawn often recommends a specific act of kindness: at
    the start of each day, take two minutes to

<!-- -->

-   write an email to someone you know praising them or thanking them
    for something they did.

<!-- -->

-   **Exercise for fifteen minutes daily.** Simple cardio, even a brisk
    walk, has a powerful antidepressant impact, in many cases stronger
    (and more long-lasting) than an actual antidepressant!
