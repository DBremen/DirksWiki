One form of life-alienating communication is the use of moralistic
judgments that imply wrongness or badness on the part of those who don't
act in harmony with our values. Another form of such communication is
the use of comparisons, which can block compassion both for others and
ourselves. Life-alienating communication also obscures our awareness
that we are each responsible for our own thoughts, feelings, and
actions. Communicating our desires in the form of demands is yet another
characteristic of language that blocks compassion.

Step 1 Observation without evaluation
=====================================

The first component of NVC entails the separation of observation from
evaluation. We need to clearly observe what we are seeing, hearing, or
touching that is affecting our sense of well-being, without mixing in
any evaluation. When we combine observation with evaluation, however, we
decrease the likelihood that others will hear our intended message.
Instead, they are apt to hear criticism and thus resist what we are
saying.

Step 2 Feeling without judging
==============================

**Conversely, in the English language, it is not necessary at all to use
the word feel when we are actually expressing a feeling: we can say "I'm
feeling irritated," or simply, "I'm irritated."**
