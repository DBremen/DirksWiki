Rocks in a jar metaphor https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6m9WnNdpSw

Our Quadrant II goals are like the “big rocks.” If we put other activities the water, sand, and gravel in first, and then try to fit the big rocks in, not only will they not fit, we’ll end up making a pretty big mess in the process.

But if we know what the big rocks are and put them in first, it’s amazing how many of them we can put in and how much of the sand, gravel, and water fits in between the spaces. Regardless of what else actually does fit in, the key point is that the big rocks our Quadrant II goals are in first.

**Leave some room because to ignore the unexpected (even if it were possible) would be to live without opportunity, spontaneity, and the rich moments of which life is made.**
