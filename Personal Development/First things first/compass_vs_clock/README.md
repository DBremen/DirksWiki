# Compass vs. clock {#compass-vs-clock}

*   The clock represents our commitments, appointments, schedules, goals, activities what we do with, and how we manage our time.
*   The compass represents our vision, values, principles, mission, conscience, direction what we feel is important and how we lead our lives.
*   Focus on where you’re headed rather than how fast you’re going. (Compass vs. clock)
*   We live in a modern society that loves shortcut techniques. Yet quality of life cannot be achieved by taking the right shortcut. Consequences:
    *   Can’t seem to walk our talk
    *   Always in fire-fighting mode and never making time to do what we know would make a difference.
    *   Feeling so guilty over what we are not doing, we can’t enjoy what we do

For many of us, there’s a gap between the compass and the clock between what’s deeply important to us and the way we spend our time. And this gap is not closed by the traditional time management approach of doing more things faster. In fact, many of us find that increasing our speed only makes things worse.

**Fundamental to putting first things first in our lives is leadership before management: “Am I doing the right things?” before “Am I doing things right?”**

**If we keep doing what we’re doing, we’re going to keep getting what we’re getting. One definition of insanity is “to keep doing the same things and expect different results.”**
