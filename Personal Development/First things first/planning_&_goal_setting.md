# Planning &amp; goal setting {#planning-goal-setting}

As people work together to accomplish any task, sooner or later they have to deal with five elements:

1.  Desired results: What is it we are trying to do? What outcomes do we want both quantitative and qualitative and by when?

Frustration is essentially a function of expectation. Clarifying interdependent expectations up front does a great deal to contribute to quality of life.

1.  Guidelines: What are the parameters within which we are trying to do it? What are the essential values, policies, legalities, ethics, limits, and levels of initiative to be aware of in going after the desired results?

Adapted from William Oncken’s work are the following six levels of initiative (match the level of initiative with the capacity of the individual)

1\. Wait until told

2\. Ask

3\. Recommend

4\. Act and report immediately

5\. Act and report periodically

6\. Act on own

1.  Resources: What do we have to work with? What budgetary, systemic, and human help is available and how do we access it?

It’s important to identify not only the resources available, but also how to access them, how to work with others who use the same resources, and what the limits are.

1.  Accountability: How do we measure what we are doing? What criteria will indicate the accomplishment of the desired results? Will they be measurable, observable, or discernible, or some combination of the three? To whom are we accountable? When will the accountability process take place?
2.  Consequences: Why are we trying to do it? What are the natural and logical consequences of accomplishing or not accomplishing the desired results?
