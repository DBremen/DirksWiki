## The fulfillment of the four human needs and capacities {#the-fulfillment-of-the-four-human-needs-and-capacities}

To Live, to Love, to Learn, to Leave a Legacy

*   The need to live is our physical need for such things as food, clothing, shelter, economic well-being, health.
*   The need to love is our social need to relate to other people, to belong, to love, to be loved.
*   The need to learn is our mental need to develop and to grow.
*   The need to leave a legacy is our spiritual need to have a sense of meaning, purpose, personal congruence, and contribution.

Each of these needs is vitally important. Any one of these needs, unmet, reduces quality of life. These needs are real and deep and highly interrelated. Some of us recognize that we have these needs, but we tend to see them as separate compartments of life. We think of balance as running from one area to another fast enough to spend time in each one on a regular basis. But the touching bases paradigm ignores the reality of their powerful synergy. It’s where these four needs overlap that we find true inner balance, deep fulfillment, and joy.

The key to the fire within is our spiritual need to leave a legacy. It transforms other needs into capacities for contribution.

**Only as we focus more on contributing than consuming can we create the context that makes peace in all aspects of life possible. It’s in leaving a legacy that we find meaning in living, loving, and learning.**
