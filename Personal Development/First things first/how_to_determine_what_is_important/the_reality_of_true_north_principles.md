## The reality of true north principles {#the-reality-of-true-north-principles}

As important as the needs are to fulfill, is the way we seek to fulfill them. Our ability to create quality of life is a function of the degree to which our lives are aligned with extrinsic realities as we seek to fulfill the basic human needs.

The reality of true north gives context and meaning to where we are, where we want to go, and how to get there. “True north” in the human dimension is an inner compass that empowers us to align our lives with it.

### Principles {#principles}

Principles are neither practices nor values but they are at higher level. If we understand and live our lives based on principles, we can quickly adapt; we can apply them anywhere. By teaching our children principles instead of practices, or teaching them the principles behind the practices, we better prepare them to handle the unknown challenges of the future. To understand the application may be to meet the challenge of the moment, but to understand the principle is to meet the challenge of the moment more effectively and to be empowered to meet a thousand challenges of the future as well.

#### Law of the farm {#law-of-the-farm}

In agriculture, we can easily see and agree that natural laws and principles govern the work and determine the harvest. But in social and corporate cultures, we somehow think we can dismiss natural processes, cheat the system, and still win the day.

In the short run, we may be able to go for the “quick fix” with apparent success. We can make impressions, we can put on the charm. We can learn manipulative techniques what lever to pull, what button to push to get the desired reaction. But long-term, the Law of the Farm governs in all areas of life. And there’s no way to fake the harvest.

The problems in life come when we’re sowing one thing and expecting to reap something entirely different.
