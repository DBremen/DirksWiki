## The potentiality of the four human endowments {#the-potentiality-of-the-four-human-endowments}

As human beings, we have unique endowments that distinguish us from the animal world. These endowments reside in that space between stimulus and response, between those things that happen to us and our response to them.

“Between stimulus and response, there is a space.

In that space is our power to choose our response.

In our response lies our growth and our freedom. “

The endowments that reside in this space self-awareness, conscience, creative imagination, and independent will create our ultimate human freedom: the power to choose, to respond, and to change. They create the compass that empowers us to align our lives with true north.

### Self-awareness… {#self-awareness}

Self-awareness is our capacity to stand apart from ourselves and examine our thinking, our motives, our history, our scripts, our actions, and our habits and tendencies. It enables us to take off our glasses and look at them as well as through them. It makes it possible for us to become aware of the social and psychic history of the programs that are in us and to enlarge the separation between stimulus and response.

### Conscience {#conscience}

Conscience connects us with the wisdom of the ages and the wisdom of the heart. It’s our internal guidance system, which allows us to sense when we act or even contemplate acting in a way that’s contrary to principle. It also gives us a sense of our unique gifts and mission.

### Independent will {#independent-will}

Independent will is our capacity to act. It gives us the power to transcend our paradigms, to swim upstream, to rewrite our scripts, to act based on principle rather than reacting based on emotion or circumstance. While environmental or genetic influences may be very powerful, they do not control us. We’re not victims. We’re not the product of our past. We are the product of our choices. We are “response-able” able to respond, to choose beyond our moods and tendencies. We have will power to act on self-awareness, conscience, and vision.

### Creative imagination {#creative-imagination}

Creative imagination is the power to envision a future state, to create something in our mind, and to solve problems synergistically. It’s the endowment that enables us to see ourselves and others differently and better than we are now. It enables us to write a personal mission statement, set a goal, or plan a meeting. It also empowers us to visualize ourselves living our mission statement even in the most challenging circumstances, and to apply principles ineffective ways in new situations.

**The development of each of the four endowments and the synergy between them is the core of personal leadership.**

### How to develop your endowments {#how-to-develop-your-endowments}

**Our lives are the results of our choices. To blame and accuse other people, the environment, or other extrinsic factors is to choose to empower those things to control us.**

*   Nurture **Self-awareness** by Keeping a Personal Journal
*   Educate the **Conscience** by Learning, Listening, and Responding
    *   reading and pondering over the wisdom literature of the ages to broaden our awareness of the true north principles that run as common themes throughout time
    *   standing apart from and learning from our own experience
    *   carefully observing the experience of others
    *   taking time to be still and listen to that deep inner voice
    *   Responding to that voice. Disobedience to conscience makes conscience blind.
*   Nurture **Independent Will** by Making and Keeping Promises
    *   Each time we do this, we make deposits in our Personal Integrity Account.
    *   Don’t violate that commitment and be sure you don’t overpromise and underdeliver. Build slowly until your sense of honor becomes greater than your moods. Think carefully about the full reality you’re in, and based on that careful thought, move into it and say, “I will do this.” And then, no matter what, do it.
    *   Little by little, your faith in yourself will increase. And if the thing you’ve committed to do is principle-centered, you gradually become a little more principle-centered. Little by little we increase our strength until our ability to act is more powerful than any of the forces that act upon us.
*   Develop Creative Imagination through Visualization
    *   Set aside some time to be alone, away from interruptions. Close your eyes and visualize
    *   The best way to predict your future is to create it.
