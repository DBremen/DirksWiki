## Seek First to Understand {#seek-first-to-understand}

As you seek mutual understanding, you may find it helpful to address the following questions:

*   **What is the problem from the other point of view?**

Really listen with intent to understand, not to reply. Step out of your own autobiography. Work at it until you can express the other personâ€™s point of view better than he or she can. Then encourage the other person to do the same.

*   **What are the key issues (not viewpoints) involved?**

Once the viewpoints are expressed and both parties feel thoroughly understood, look at the problem together and identify the issues that need to be resolved.

*   **What results would constitute a fully acceptable solution?**

Find out what would constitute a win for the other person. Identify what would constitute a win for you. Put both criteria on the table as the foundation for synergistic interaction.
