# Preventing anger {#preventing-anger}

**Anger is the emotion of intolerance. Intolerance means you don’t accept another person’s viewpoint or behavior. Anger says that you think you’re right and the other person is wrong. It can’t be any simpler than that.**

Anger defends the listener against any change in his way of thinking. Instead of accepting the challenge of an honest difference of opinion, the intolerant person resorts to intimidation, insult, or withdrawal — all fueled by anger —as a way of rigidly holding on to his beliefs.

Instead of being defensive (that’s what intolerance is all about!), go on the offense. Say to the other person, **“Tell me more about that. I’d like to understand how you arrived at that opinion. This is your chance to educate me.”**

**Look for points of agreement**

**Keep your eyes open and your mouth shut.**
