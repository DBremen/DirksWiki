# A Zen approach to overcoming anger {#a-zen-approach-to-overcoming-anger}

Anger is often an immediate but irrational reaction based on a notion we have in our heads.

Whether the event is trivial or significant, the cause of anger is always the same. Underlying the emotional tumult, there is a need that is not being met and that you expect to be met. The demand, in a very broad sense, is the “because” underlying our anger. “I was angry because . . . .”

If you can pause to consider what your demand (or need or expectation) is when you feel anger arising, you will have gone a long way toward changing it. Whether or not you follow any of the other suggestions in this book, you will find this simple exercise to be of great value. In fact, certain types of anger may dissolve with no other effort.

So the first step is to own your anger. As long as you don’t act on it, no one but you will keep score no matter how many times a day you get angry.

One of the things that you realize when you see the nature of the self is that what you do and what happens to you are the same thing. Realizing that you do not exist separately from everything else, you realize responsibility: You are responsible for everything you experience. You can no longer say, ‘He made me angry.’ How could he make you angry? Only you can make you angry.

On the temple it is written even still . . . that the giver should be thankful; only then is it a sharing. . . . Somebody accepted you through your gift. He could have rejected [it], there was no necessity to accept it. The giver should be thankful. Then it becomes a sharing, otherwise it is always a bargain. You are expecting something—something more valuable than you have given. When someone becomes enlightened, he can share, and he will do whatsoever he can just to share it.

When confronted with someone else’s anger, use these steps.

1.  Make space before speaking or responding. Take some deep breaths.
2.  Check the face and body of the person in front of you to understand what’s going on. Observe physiological cues. Watch especially for changes in the trust level. When a person becomes more relaxed, their eyes will be open and they will lean slightly toward you.
3.  Consider the consequences of not doing anything—whether something that might be helpful in the short run may lead to harm later.
4.  Ask yourself: What assumptions am I making? Ask the person what the problem is. Consider your involvement in causing it.
5.  Respect and empathize with both your own boundaries, values, and limitations and those of the other person.

A conflict may be the result of differing values, for instance, two family members disagreeing about whether to take care of a parent in a nursing facility or at home. One wants safety for her, the other wants her happiness. The safety-minded person might come clean and admit, “I can’t be here all the time; I’m afraid she might hurt herself.” The other might say, “I would always be upset with myself if I didn’t support Mother’s wishes.” Then it becomes an argument about concerns instead of positions.

1.  Speak from right attitude. Ask yourself, “What do I really need to communicate to this person?” and refrain from venting your feelings for other motives. Check for self-indulgence, ill will, potential harm in one’s own words and actions. Ask yourself not only what must I say, but how must I say it.
2.  Deliberately, do not take revenge. In Buddhism, the basic vow is benefiting all beings, not everyone except this particular person.

If you are a man who leads,Listen calmly to the speech of one who pleads;Don’t stop him from purging his body Of that which he planned to tell.A man in distress wants to pour out his heartMore than that his case be won.

—The Instructions of Ptahhotep

If you don’t like what just happened, you have the opportunity to change the next installment in the soap opera of your life in grand or subtle ways. Human intelligence gives you the power to react other than by instinct or habit. Intelligence is the power of choice. Anger cripples rational thought and therefore limits your choices. But by using the full power of your intellect and choosing not to act out of anger and habit, you can increase the odds that the events of the future will be more to your liking.
