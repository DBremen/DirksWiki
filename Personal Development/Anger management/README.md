# Anger management {#anger-management}

**Anger management is really all about mind over matter.** It’s about giving yourself adequate time to respond to your feelings, asking the right questions about your anger, choosing how to respond when you get mad, and deciding if you’re willing to pay the consequences for outrageous behavior.

**Just because you have the right to be angry doesn’t mean you have to exercise that right!**

*   **Acknowledge your anger as soon as you experience it.**
*   **Use your anger to better understand yourself.**
*   **Express your anger without venting**
*   **Stop saying you’re “fine” when you’re not.**
*   **Confess your anger on a daily basis.**
*   **Think of anger as your ally rather than your enemy.**
*   **Find healthy ways — like exercise — to let off steam.**
*   **Think of anger as a legitimate emotion just like love and joy.**
*   **Start saying “Excuse you!” to people who treat you badly.**
*   **Let yourself off the hook by forgiving others.**
*   **Live in the present, not the past.**
*   **Forgo reciprocity — there’s no such thing as getting even.**
*   **Come back and discuss the reasons for your anger after you walk away.**

**Anger is neither bad nor good**

Anger serves a variety of positive purposes when it comes to coping with stress. It energizes you, improves your communication with other people, promotes your self-esteem, and defends you against fear and insecurity. (Jesus, Gandhi, and Martin Luther King, Jr., were all angry men — but they turned that anger into social reform that made the world a better place.)

When it leads to domestic violence, property damage, sexual abuse, drug addiction, ulcers, and self-mutilation, anger is definitely not good.

**You want to have emotions but you want to be in control of those emotions.**
