# Why we get mad? {#why-we-get-mad}

Anger is good for you as long as you understand, manage, and use it in healthy ways. Like all emotions, anger exists in us because it offered our human and nonhuman ancestors a survival benefit. These brain structures, facial expressions, and body postures did not happen by accident. They happened through hundreds of millions of years of our ancestors surviving hostile forces of nature.

1.  Anger alerts you to injustice.
2.  Anger energizes you to confront injustice.
3.  Anger communicates your status to others.

Anger is, pure and simple, an emotion. It is the feeling state that arises in us when we have our goals blocked or when we experience an injustice. Emotions are fundamentally separate from behaviors.

    3.  Secondary appraisal -&gt; decide how bad the situation is and whether we can cope with it
