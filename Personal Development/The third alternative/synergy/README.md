# Synergy {#synergy}

**Most conflicts are two-sided (Black or White). The 1st Alternative is my way, the 2nd Alternative is your way. By synergizing, we can go on to a 3rd Alternativeâ€”our way, a higher and better way to resolve the conflict.**

*   Without synergy: 1 + 1 &lt; 2
*   With synergy: 1 + 1 &gt; 2

**The natural principle that the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. Rather than going my way or your way, we take the path of synergy to higher and more productive results. You and I together are far greater than we are alone.**

**Our paradigms govern our behavior, which in turn governs the consequences of our actions. We GET results based on what we DO, and what we DO depends on how we SEE the world around us.**
