## Putting too much pressure on your kids {#putting-too-much-pressure-on-your-kids}

Many of the expectations we have of our children are unspoken. Despite what we don’t put into words, children intuitively sense when we wish them to be other than they are—sense that we want them to fulfill our fantasies of who they will grow up to be and what they will accomplish. 

Don’t think your kid is too shy, too much of an introvert or anything else just let them be themselves. Many children suffer from guilt, and in many cases live in a state of shame, because they are unable to perform to their parents’ satisfaction.

Placing expectations on your child instead of allowing the child’s own natural inclinations to emerge spontaneously may well result in an emotional Grand Canyon between you and your child. As the gap widens, a flood of anxiety will rush in to fill it—anxiety not only for your child but also for yourself.
