## From judgement to empathy {#from-judgement-to-empathy}

When we truly feel empathy for another, there is no agenda. A genuinely empathic response immediately recognizes that the other is in a state that’s vastly different from our own, and that in order to connect with them we will have to forgo completely our own agenda. This swift letting go requires an alive presence that understands how connection with another is an engagement in which energy flows back and forth moment by moment with no guarantee of how things will end up. We understand that it’s about the process of communicating, rather than where we need to end up or whose agenda needs to be met. It fully recognizes the importance of walking every step of the process together, with both parties engaged and empowered.

Empathy is the ability to connect with what the other is feeling. This requires us to accept that it’s okay for our child, partner, or friend to feel a certain way. Of course they do, since we are two distinct beings. This is the natural order of things in a healthy relationship. We don’t need to change the other, any more than we need to change ourselves. We simply need to recognize the validity of the other’s feelings, even as we want our own feelings to be recognized. Initially, holding the space within ourselves for both perspectives is extremely challenging. We can do this only if we aren’t under siege from our own emotions. Anxiety constricts our inner space, causing it to quickly morph into control, which soon becomes anger.

*   Do” sit close to your child in complete silence.
*   “Do” look into their eyes and keep your gaze on them.
*   “Do” softly echo back their feelings to them.
*   “Do” show them with your body posture that you are there for them.
*   “Do” try to understand their experiences without being intrusive.
*   “Do” keep your opinions, sermons, and lectures to yourself.
*   “Do” assure them that their feelings are important.
*   “Do” give them the space to sit quietly and feel what they are feeling until it becomes integrated.
*   “Do” validate that their feelings are just fine simply because they are theirs and not something to be ashamed of.
*   “Do” tap into your own anxiety and work through it.

**~ A New Commitment to Shedding Judgment ~**

My judgment against others

Erupts from a place of lack within,

From an old blueprint

Where I was judged by others in the same way.

Though judgment is far easier than introspection,

I realize that it keeps my heart closed.

It is only when I can enter compassion for others

That I ultimately can forgive myself.
