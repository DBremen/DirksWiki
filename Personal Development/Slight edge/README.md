# Slight edge {#slight-edge}

**_The difficult is what takes a little time; the impossible is what takes a little longer._**

In each area of my life, did I do those things that are easy to do, and easy not to do? Did I continue my momentum on the success curve?”

Time is the force that magnifies those simple daily disciplines into massive success.

There is a natural progression to success: plant, cultivate, harvest—and the central step, _cultivate,_ can only happen over the course of time.

No genuine success in life is instant. Life is not a clickable link.

To grasp how the slight edge works, you have to view your actions through the eyes of time.

**Success is not the key to happiness. Happiness is the key to success**

Daily:

*   **Each morning, write down three things you’re grateful for.** Not the same three every day; find three _new_ things to write about. That trains your brain to search your circumstances and hunt for the positive.
*   **Journal for two minutes a day about one positive experience you’ve had over the past twenty-four hours.** Write down every detail you can remember; this causes your brain to literally reexperience the experience, which doubles its positive impact.
*   **Meditate daily.** Nothing fancy; just stop all activity, relax, and watch your breath go in and out for two minutes. This trains your brain to focus where you want it to, and not get distracted by negativity in your environment.
*   **Do a random act of kindness over the course of each day.** To make this simple, Shawn often recommends a specific act of kindness: at the start of each day, take two minutes to
*   write an email to someone you know praising them or thanking them for something they did.
*   **Exercise for fifteen minutes daily.** Simple cardio, even a brisk walk, has a powerful antidepressant impact, in many cases stronger (and more long-lasting) than an actual antidepressant!
