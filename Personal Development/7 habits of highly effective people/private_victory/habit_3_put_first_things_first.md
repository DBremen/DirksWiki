## Habit 3: Put First Things First {#habit-3-put-first-things-first}

Habit 3, then, is the second creation -- the physical creation. It&#039;s the fulfillment, the actualization, the natural emergence of Habits 1 and 2\. It&#039;s the exercise of independent will toward becoming principle-centered. It&#039;s the day-in, day-out, moment-by-moment doing it.

The key is not to prioritize what&#039;s on your schedule, but to schedule your priorities. And this can best be done in the context of the week.

**Quadrant I** – Important and Urgent – crises, deadline-driven projects, and pressing problems**Quadrant II** – Important and Not Urgent – preparation, planning, and relationship building**Quadrant III** – Not Important and Urgent – interruptions, most phone calls and mail and reports**Quadrant IV** – Not Important and Not Urgent – trivia, busywork, time wasters, and escape activities

Quadrant II organizing involves four key activities.

1.  Identifying Roles: The first task is to write down your key roles. If you haven&#039;t really given serious thought to the roles in your life, you can write down what immediately comes to mind. You have a role as an individual. You may want to list one or more roles as a family member -- a husband or wife, mother or father, son or daughter, a member of the extended family of grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins. You may want to list a few roles in your work, indicating different areas in which you wish to invest time and energy on a regular basis. You may have roles in church or community affairs. You don&#039;t need to worry about defining the roles in a way that you will live with for the rest of your life -- just consider the week and write down the areas you see yourself spending time in during the next seven days.

e.g.:

*   1.  Individual
    2.  Husband/Father
    3.  Manager New Products
    4.  Chairman United Way

1.  Personal Development
2.  Wife
3.  Mother
4.  Real Estate Salesperson
5.  Selecting Goals: The next step is to think of two or three important results you feel you should accomplish in each role during the next seven days. These would be recorded as goals. At least some of these goals should reflect Quadrant II activities. Ideally, these short-term goals would be tied to the longer-term goals you have identified in conjunction with your personal mission statement. But even if you haven&#039;t written your mission statement, you can get a feeling, a sense, of what is important as you consider each of your roles and two or three goals for each role.
6.  Scheduling: Now you look at the week ahead with your goals in mind and schedule time to achieve them. For example, if your goal is to produce the first draft of your personal mission statement, you may want to set aside a two-hour block of time on Sunday to work on it. Sunday (or some other day of the week that is special to you, your faith, or your circumstances) is often the ideal time to plan your more personally uplifting activities, including weekly organizing. It&#039;s a good time to draw back, to see inspiration, to look at your life in the context of principles and values. If you set a goal to become physically fit through exercise, you may want to set aside an hour three or four days during the week, or possibly every day during the week, to accomplish that goal. There are some goals that you may only be able to accomplish during business hours, or some that you can only do on Saturday when your children are home. Can you begin to see some of the advantages of organizing the week instead of the day?
7.  Daily Adapting: With Quadrant II weekly organizing, daily planning becomes more a function of daily adapting, or prioritizing activities and responding to unanticipated events, relationships, and experiences in a meaningful way. Taking a few minutes each morning to review your schedule can put you in touch with the value-based decisions you made as you organized the week as well as unanticipated factors that may have come up. As you overview the day, you can see that your roles and goals provide a natural prioritization that grows out of your innate sense of balance. It is a softer, more right-brain prioritization that ultimately comes out of your sense of personal mission.

You simply can&#039;t think efficiency with people. **You think effectiveness with people and efficiency with things.** I&#039;ve tried to be &quot;efficient&quot; with a disagreeing or disagreeable person and it simply doesn&#039;t work. I&#039;ve tried to give 10 minutes of &quot;quality time&quot; to a child or an employee to solve a problem, only to discover such &quot;efficiency&quot; creates new problems and seldom resolves the deepest concern.

### Delegation {#delegation}

Stewardship delegation involves clear, up-front mutual understanding and commitment regarding expectations in five areas.

1.  Desired Results: Create a clear, mutual understanding of what needs to be accomplished, focusing on what, not how; results, not methods. Spend time. Be patient. Visualize the desired result. Have the person see it, describe it, make out a quality statement of what the results will look like, and by when they will be accomplished.
2.  Guidelines: Identify the parameters within which the individual should operate. These should be as few as possible to avoid methods delegation, but should include any formidable restrictions. You won&#039;t want a person to think he had considerable latitude as long as he accomplished the objectives, only to violate some long-standing traditional practice or value. That kills initiative and sends people back to the gofer&#039;s creed: &quot;Just tell me what you want me to do, and I&#039;ll do it.&quot;

Let people learn from your mistakes or the mistakes of others. Point out the potential failure

paths, what not to do, but don&#039;t tell them what to do. Keep the responsibility for results with them -- to do whatever is necessary within the guidelines.

1.  Resources: Identify the human, financial, technical, or organizational resources the person can draw on to accomplish the desired results.
2.  Accountability: Set up the standards of performance that will be used in evaluating the results and the specific times when reporting and evaluation will take place.
3.  Consequences: Specify what will happen, both good and bad, as a result of the evaluation. This could include such things as financial rewards, psychic rewards, different job assignments, and natural consequences tied into the overall mission of an organization.
