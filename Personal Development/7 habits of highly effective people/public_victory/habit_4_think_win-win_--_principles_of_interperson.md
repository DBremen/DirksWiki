## Habit 4: Think Win-Win -- Principles of Interpersonal Leadership {#habit-4-think-win-win-principles-of-interpersonal-leadership}

Win-win is not a technique; it&#039;s a total philosophy of human interaction. In fact, it is one of six paradigms of interaction. The alternative paradigms are win-lose, lose-win, lose-lose, win, and Win-Win or No Deal

Win-win is a frame of mind and heart that constantly seeks mutual benefit in all human interactions. Win-win means that agreements or solutions are mutually beneficial, mutually satisfying. With a win-win solution, all parties feel good about the decision and feel committed to the action plan. Win-win sees life as a cooperative, not a competitive arena. Most people tend to think in terms of dichotomies: strong or weak, hardball or softball, win or lose. But that kind of thinking if fundamentally flawed. It&#039;s based on power and position rather than on principle. Win-win is based on the paradigm that there is plenty for everybody, that one person&#039;s success is not achieved at the expense or exclusion of the success of others. Win-win is a belief in the Third Alternative. It&#039;s not your way or my way; it&#039;s a better way, a higher way.

No deal basically means that if we can&#039;t find a solution that would benefit us both, we agree to disagree agreeably -- no deal. No expectations have been created, no performance contracts established. I don&#039;t hire you or we don&#039;t take on a particular assignment together because it&#039;s obvious that our values or our goals are going in opposite directions. It is so much better to realize this up front instead of downstream when expectations have been created and both parties have been disillusioned.

Anything less than win-win in an interdependent reality is a poor second best that will have impact in the long-term relationship. The cost of the impact needs to be carefully considered. If you can&#039;t reach a true win-win, you&#039;re very often better off to go for no deal. Win-Win or No Deal provides tremendous emotional freedom in the family relationship.

If family members can&#039;t agree on a video that everyone will enjoy, they can simply decide to do something else -- no deal -- rather than having some enjoy the evening at the expense of others.

In my own work with various people and organizations seeking win-win solutions, I suggest that they become involved in the following four-step process:

1.  See the problem from the other point of view. Really seek to understand and give expression to the needs and concerns of the other party as well as or better than they can themselves.
2.  Identify the key issues and concerns (not positions) involved.
3.  Determine what results would constitute a fully acceptable solution.
4.  Identify possible new options to achieve those results.
