# Non violent communications {#non-violent-communications}

122

One form of life-alienating communication is the use of moralistic judgments that imply wrongness or badness on the part of those who donâ€™t act in harmony with our values. Another form of such communication is the use of comparisons, which can block compassion both for others and ourselves. Life-alienating communication also obscures our awareness that we are each responsible for our own thoughts, feelings, and actions. Communicating our desires in the form of demands is yet another characteristic of language that blocks compassion.
