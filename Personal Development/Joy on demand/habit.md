# Habit {#habit}

A habit is a loop that consists of three parts: a cue, a routine, and a reward.<sup>7</sup> The cue is something that activates the habit—it leads to the routine. The routine is the behavior itself—it leads to the reward. The reward is the perceived benefit that comes from doing the behavior, and it reinforces the habit so that the next occurrence of the same cue is more likely to automatically activate the routine. Thus a loop forms.

**INFORMAL PRACTICE: CREATING A HABIT OF TAKING MINDFUL BREATHS**

Choose a cue, something that, when it occurs, activates the habit of taking a mindful breath. The cue I most highly recommend is any situation when you have to wait.

Whenever the cue occurs, take one slow, deep breath and bring some amount of attention to that breath. For safety reasons (for example, if you’re walking or driving), you may need to maintain an appropriate amount of attention to your surroundings as you pay some attention to your breath.

If taking that mindful breath makes you feel any better, simply notice that. It will be the reward that reinforces the habit.
