# Inclining the mind toward joy {#inclining-the-mind-toward-joy}

Next, we learn to notice joy and give it our full attention. We learn where to look in order to see and appreciate joy that is already available to us, in moments that we hadnâ€™t noticed before. The more the mind becomes familiar with joy, the more it perceives joy, inclines toward joy, and effortlessly creates the conditions conducive to joy.

**FORMAL PRACTICE: INVITING AND ATTENDING TO JOY**

Sit in any posture that allows you to be alert and relaxed at the same time, whatever that means to you. You may keep your eyes open or closed.

Let us take three breaths. In the first breath, bring gentle but intense attention to the process of breathing. In the second breath, calm the body. In the third breath, bring up joy. If necessary, bring up a smile or a half smile, whatever the words _half smile_ mean to you. If any joy arises, bring full attention to it. If you like, repeat this three-breaths practice a few more times.
