# Easing into joy {#easing-into-joy}

Resting the mind to put it into a state of ease. Being joyful at rest, no ego stroking or sensual pleasure required. Cultivating this form of inner joy begins to free us from overreliance on sense and ego stimulation for pleasure. This means joy becomes increasingly available anyplace, anytime.

**Whenever there is any experience of joy,just notice it. That is all.**

**FORMAL PRACTICE: NOTICING JOY IN ONE BREATH**

Do the One Mindful Breath exercise from Chapter 2, which is simply to take one deep breath mindfully. If any hint of joy arises anytime during the exercise, **simply notice it,** that is all. If no hint of joy arises, no problem either; we simply **notice the absence** of joy.
