# Meditation is not about not thinking {#meditation-is-not-about-not-thinking}

One of the biggest misconceptions about meditation is that it involves “emptying your mind of all thoughts.” This one misconception is more responsible for turning people away from meditation than any other that I know of. Meditation is about allowing the mind to settle on its own terms, in its own time, which includes allowing thoughts to arise as and when they want to. It is true that over time, with practice, as the mind becomes more deeply settled, the stream of thoughts slows down and eventually goes from being like a raging waterfall to being like a fast-flowing river, then more like a slow-flowing stream, and finally, the mind is like a placid lake. Over time (in my own case, after many, many hours of meditation practice), the mind learns to quiet down on demand, but that does not come from suppressing the process of thinking—instead, it comes from learning to give the mind the space and time to settle on its own terms. Meditation is not what you think, or not think.

A skillful meditator periodically does three things: periodically he arouses mental energy, periodically he calms the mind, and periodically he watches the mind with equanimity. Simply put, skillfully managing energy in meditation boils down to balancing three mental factors: **mental relaxation, mental energy,** and **equanimous watching.**
