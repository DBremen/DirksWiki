# Biconditional premise (equivalence &lt;=&gt;) {#biconditional-premise-equivalence}

One of the big goals of ethical thinking is to try to identify a good, wide-ranging test of what’s morally right (or wrong). One way to think about such a test is to view it as a statement of conditions that are both necessary and sufficient for being morally right (or wrong). A claim that supplies necessary and sufficient conditions is called a biconditional.

A shorthand way to state biconditionals is to use this phrase: if and only if. someone is a bachelor if and only if he is an unmarried male. This says that being an unmarried male is both sufficient and necessary for being a bachelor: if someone is an unmarried male, then he’s a bachelor, and he’s a bachelor only if he’s an unmarried male.

Think of this as a kind of fill-in-the-blank exercise. In moral philosophy, we want **sufficient conditions** for being morally right. So: **if (fill in your sufficient condition), then an act is morally right.**

Now make sure that however you filled in that blank is also a **necessary condition**: An act is morally right **only if** **(fill in your sufficient condition)**. **The very same thing needs to fill in both blanks. So: an act is morally right if and only if.** If you can fill in that blank in a way that withstands scrutiny, you will have done something truly great. You will have identified conditions that guarantee the moral rightness of an act, and that are also required for the act to be right.
