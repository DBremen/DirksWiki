# Arguments validity {#arguments-validity}

1.  Identify all of an argument’s premises.
2.  Imagine that all of them are true (even if you know that some are false).
3.  Then ask yourself this question: supposing that all of the premises were true, could the conclusion be false? If yes, the argument is invalid. The premises do not guarantee the conclusion. If no, the argument is valid. The premises offer perfect logical support for the conclusion.

Validity is a matter of how well an argument’s premises support its conclusion. To test for this, we must assume that all of an argument’s premises are true. We then ask whether the conclusion must therefore be true. If so, the argument is valid. If not, not.

**Note that an argument’s validity is a matter of the argument’s structure. It has nothing to do with the actual truth or falsity of an argument’s premises or conclusion.** Indeed, valid arguments may contain false premises and false conclusions.
