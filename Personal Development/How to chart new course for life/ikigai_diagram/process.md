## Process {#process}

1.  Use the diagram template above
2.  Identify at least 3 elements for each of the four circles
3.  Divide the elements into 2 groups
    1.  Ends – vision &amp; value
    2.  Means - activities
4.  Examine your results. How could you combine the elements into your ideal lifestyle? How can the means give you a route to the ends? Are all the areas well cared for? Is there anything you might eliminate? Look for synergy (see below) and sketch out a vision of how they might come together:
5.  Check for congruency. Can you visualize your ideal lifestyle? Does this vision resonate with you? Would your needs be fulfilled? Keep rearranging the elements until you are satisfied with your result. You can try diagramming as many versions of a vision as you like until one resonates.
6.  Reflect on your current situation and how it differs from your ikigai circle and the resulting vision you created. Which of your needs are not fulfilled? What is causing you stress? Which part of the ikigai diagram do you currently spend most of your time in?
7.  Plan a transition — how could you move from your current situation towards the center of the diagram? Which areas require the most attention?
