For finding your purpose in life

In order to make the most of the ikigai framework, there are two concepts to keep in mind: balance and synergy.

Imagine the ikigai diagram as an elaborate balance scale with 4 weighing pans. Placing too much pressure on a single pan will disturb the equilibrium. In order to maintain balance, all 4 dimensions need to be equally cared for. Try to aim for how you can make use of apparently conflicting elements to harness potential synergies between them.
