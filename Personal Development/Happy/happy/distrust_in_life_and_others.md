### Distrusting Others and Why Trust is Important {#distrusting-others-and-why-trust-is-important}

Generally, people are more trustworthy than expected

By trusting others, one increases their chance of happiness by building mutual trust in our community

You can build a network of trusted people by starting to trust more people

66 = low end of average level of interpersonal trust in people

Smart trust = maximizing benefit of trust while avoiding to get hurt

Learn to forgive those who cheated you

Make people who violate your trust accountable (no revenge, no feeling of superiority)

### Distrusting life {#distrusting-life}

Don’t rely on outcomes for happiness. A good outcome may lead to negative things and a negative outcome may lead to good things

Focus on the process rather than the outcome as a source of happiness

External outcomes only account for 10% of our happiness

Genetic propensity = 50%

Attitude towards life = 40%

Good thing bad thing how knows (story of the guy who wanted to have horses)

Try to pursue the outcome you desire and enjoy the process

Don’t judge the outcome after it occurred and accept it, even if it is not the outcome you desired

Keep it mind that previously perceived negative outcomes turned into positive ones

Look for opportunities that a negative outcome might have

Believe that everything happens for a good reason
