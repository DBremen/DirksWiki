# How To Win People To Your Way Of Thinking {#how-to-win-people-to-your-way-of-thinking}

*   A man convinced against his will is of the same opinion still.
*   The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it.
*   Show respect for the other person&#039;s opinions. Never say, &quot;You&#039;re wrong.&quot;
    *   Men must be taught as if you taught them not and things unknown proposed as things forgot.
    *   You cannot teach a man anything; you can only help him to find it within himself.
    *   If a person makes a statement that you think is wrong - yes, even that you know is wrong - isn&#039;t it better to begin by saying: &quot;Well, now, look, I thought otherwise, but I may be wrong. I frequently am. And if I am wrong, I want to be put right. Let&#039;s examine the facts.&quot;
*   If you are wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically.
*   Begin in a friendly way. (a drop of honey attracts more flies than a gallon of gal)
*   **Get the other person saying &quot;yes, yes&quot; immediately**. (find things you agree on)
*   **Let the other person do a great deal of the talking**.
*   Let the other person feel that the idea is his or hers.
*   Try honestly to see things from the other person&#039;s point of view.
*   Be sympathetic with the other person&#039;s ideas and desires.
*   Appeal to the nobler motives.
*   Dramatize your ideas. (It works in the movies and in adds)
*   Throw down a challenge.
