## Emails {#emails}

Avoid email addition:

*   Disable email notifications
*   Don’t do emails first thing in the morning ( use energy for something for useful )
*   Allocate only certain, fixed times during the day to fully focus on e-mail.

Before sending:

*   **Should this e-mail be sent at all? And should all these people be copied?**
    *   E-mail is widely overused. Make sure you’re not just adding to the chatter. Make sure your e-mail really needs to be sent. It’s okay to delete an e-mail if it really isn’t that important.
*   **Does the e-mail contain the information needed for it to be understood correctly?**
    *   We’ve all sent or received a message without an attachment or other key detail. Oversights like these can cause multiple messages to go back and forth, all with similar ques- tions. Make sure you aren’t wasting valuable time—yours or any- one else’s.
*   **How will the recipient perceive this e-mail?**
    *   Put yourself in the recipient’s shoes. How can you phrase this note to best avoid negative speculation in the recipient’s mind? Taking just one second to think about how your e-mail will be perceived can be the difference between clear communication and an unfortunate misunderstanding. One thing is certain: saying “thanks” and “sorry” are always good ideas.

**Avoid Emotional E-mailing**

*   Wait one day before replying. When you come across an e-mail that generates negative reactions, stop. Do not give in to the impulse to answer immediately.
*   Think about alternative communications channels.
