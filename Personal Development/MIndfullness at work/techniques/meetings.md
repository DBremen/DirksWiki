## Meetings {#meetings}

### Before {#before}

Preparing: Before you introduce an agenda, simply invite meeting participants to take a brief mental break, to relax, settle their mind, and become present in the room. Sitting in a room silently for a few moments can create a strong feeling of togetherness and unity.

### During {#during}

Be present: In meetings, presence forms the foundation for effectiveness. When we’re present with other people, we get the most out of our time together. Therefore, the fundamental rule for a mindful meeting is: be completely present with those you are together with for as long as you are together.

**Every meeting you’re in, you have the opportunity to make the people you’re with the anchor of your attention. To do so, focus your attention on the person who is speaking.**

### After {#after}

Fitting in some time at the end of a meeting to practice mindfulness can also be of benefit in terms of softening a hard stop. Taking just a few minutes can help further clear the mind and increase relaxation, focus, and clarity for upcoming activities.

In fact, some companies have begun letting meetings finish a few minutes early, giving participants the opportunity to settle and clear their minds before their next activity. Also, if the meeting finishes at an appropriate time, there’s less of a rush. This means you have the opportunity to look coworkers in the eye and thank them for their time and attention. When a meeting is concluded with gratitude and appreciation, people are more willing to meet again and a positive pat- tern for meetings develops.
