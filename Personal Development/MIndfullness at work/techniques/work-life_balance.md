## Work-life balance {#work-life-balance}

Imbalance is only a problem if people perceive it that way or if work negatively impacts other areas of life.

**Focus —**Training in mindfulness helps you feel less overwhelmed by daily tasks and challenges. It helps provide the clarity of mind to accept what you can’t change, and make mindful choices about where to place your limited attention—in a way that best serves you and others. Further, it helps you be present with the imbalance, allowing you to sit with the discomfort, observe it, and not let it overwhelm your mind.

**Awareness** —Training in mindfulness helps you maintain awareness of when you’re not in balance. It helps keep you from falling into habitual patterns that are unhealthy, both for yourself and others around you. It also helps you distinguish between what you can and can’t control.

Mindfulness helps you maintain balance within yourself by accepting life’s imbalances. It allows you to let go of things outside of your control, saving all that mental energy to manage things within your control and thereby reducing stress and worry.
