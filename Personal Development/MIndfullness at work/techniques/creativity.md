## Creativity {#creativity}

Take more intentional pauses throughout these meetings to give people the opportunity to relax and release any of the attachment they had to one idea or another.

1.  Formulate the Problem (and write it down)
2.  Let go of the problem
3.  Allow time
4.  Activate

Youâ€™ve now identified a problem, let it go, and given your subconscious time to work. The final task is to help your subconscious communicate with your conscious.
