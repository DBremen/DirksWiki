## Activity and energy {#activity-and-energy}

**When you have positive physical experiences, your mind smiles.** In this way, caring for the body is just as impactful as caring for the mind. Getting good and sufficient sleep, eating properly, and being physically active are all foundations for both performance and well- being.

Maintaining a clear focus while undertaking physical activity trans- forms a workout into a semi-mindfulness session and will improve your experience.

**Relaxation—The Absence of Unnecessary Effort**

A relaxed body—one absent of unnecessary tension—has greater endurance and generally feels more pleasant. As you train, occasionally Activity and Energy scan your body for signs of unnecessary effort or tension. Then relax. The more relaxed you are, the more you can do and the more you’ll enjoy it.

While relaxation is also important for the mind to avoid thinking and distraction, the mind needs an object of focus. You need to have an anchor—and that anchor is usually your breath. While breathing is a great anchor while you’re sitting still, it’s equally powerful during physical activity. But breath alone may not be enough. Instead, it can be more effective to synchronize your breath with the natural rhythm of your physical activity. When you run or walk, synchronize your steps with your breath. Take a certain number of steps for each inhalation and each exhalation. This way, you can easily maintain a focused and steady rhythm for long periods. It’s often easier than just focusing on your breathing.

Focus and rhythm can be a big help, especially if you feel poorly or experience pain. Most unpleasantness comes from our thoughts. Thoughts come from physical sensations or other distractions. Your focus creates your reality. Focus on unpleasantness, and your reality will be unpleasant. Instead, focus on your breathing and rhythm—and experience one moment at a time. As distractions appear, don’t try to suppress them. Simply take one moment after the other: one step after the other. Inhale and exhale. Don’t think about how much time you have left. Stay in the moment. With relaxed focus, any unpleasantness or pain will diminish.
