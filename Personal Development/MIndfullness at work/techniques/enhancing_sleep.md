## Enhancing sleep {#enhancing-sleep}

*   TURN off All Screens 60 Minutes before Sleep
*   Perceptual Activities 60 Minutes before Sleep

Conceptual activities like intense conversations, replying to e-mails, working, or reading can arouse your attention and suppress your natural sleepiness. Instead of doing the dishes and other practical activities just after dinner, leave that for the last hour before sleep, instead of screen activities.

### Waking Mindfully {#waking-mindfully}

As you wake, be determined not to start thinking. Just be. Notice your body. Notice your mind. But do not engage in the thoughts trying to arise. Sit up, at the edge of your bed, and do two minutes of mindfulness training. Focus on your breath and let go of any thoughts.
