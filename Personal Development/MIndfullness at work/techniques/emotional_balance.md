## Emotional balance {#emotional-balance}

Emotions are a natural part of being human. Managed skillfully, they’re a powerful source of joy and energy. Unsuccessfully managed, however, they can get in the way, becoming a source of frustration, conflict, and regret.

In reality, having emotional balance equates to not getting caught up in the natural ups and downs of our emotions. Emotional balance is a state of being aware of our emotions enough to manage them in a way that is gentle, honest, and wise.

Mirroring others’ emotions is normal; it’s your mirror neurons at play. More about mirror neurons is presented in the mental strategy of Joy. But in short, when we face someone joyful, mirror neurons in our brains make us experience a similar joy. The same goes for anger, grief, and almost all other emotions.

Most of us deal with our emotions by either suppressing them or acting them out. The thing about suppressing emotions is that they have to go somewhere. Like pressing down on a balloon, pushing your emotions down only means they will pop up again somewhere else. Additionally, suppressing emotions requires an enormous amount of mental energy—energy that’s diverted from our own focus and clarity. Acting out our emotions, whether aggressively or passive aggressively, might feel good in the moment. But if acting out is effective at all, it’s only in that moment. In the long run, acting out our emotions usually leads to disappointment, regret, or shame.

In mindfulness training, we work to develop the mental capacity, the patience, and the courage to endure discomfort. At the same time, we learn to observe our emotions with some neutrality. We put some kind of distance between our emotions and ourselves. Instead of running on autopilot, being absorbed with emotion and caught in its grip, we take a moment to pause. We stay one second ahead of automatic reactions, giving ourselves the time, space, and freedom to make conscious, deliberate choices.

Whereas patience can help you ride out the emotion, balance can keep you neutral. Balance can help you avoid any automatic aversion or attraction you may have toward it. With the ability to embrace the emotion with patience and balance, you can now maintain the focus Emotional Balance and clarity necessary to determine the best, most productive response to it.
