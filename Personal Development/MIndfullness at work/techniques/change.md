## Change {#change}

We are habitual beings. In fact, scientists estimate that 95 percent of our behaviors are based on habit. In other words, only 5 percent of what we do is based on conscious choice. Not only are we habitual, but we’re also neurologically programmed to prefer that things stay the same. Familiarity provides us with a greater sense of psychological safety.

Learning to embrace the reality of constant change is a powerful thing. When we experience a great day at work—or a challenging day—without expecting that the next day will be the same, we become much more resilient in the face of change. Building greater acceptance of the reality of constant change is a foundation for more balance, less stress, better health, and ultimately more peace of mind.

Hardwired to value certainty, our natural response is to resist uncertainty in our environment. In fact, it would be strange if we didn’t experience some resistance to change. Since we’re habitual beings, doing anything differently takes effort. Even if the change is something we want, it requires effort to overcome both our neurological impulse to keep things the same as well as our ingrained habitual patterns.

**When we try to resist resistance, we only generate more of it.** We create an inner struggle that often leads to anger, frustration, stress, and anxiety. Resisting resistance doesn’t help us move forward; instead, it negatively impacts both our health and well-being.

The key to managing resistance and thereby better managing change is to face it and embrace it.

Once you’re able to observe your resistance, see whether there’s anything you can learn from it. Are you resisting simply because of your natural preference for familiarity? Or are you resisting because something legitimately doesn’t make sense? Seeking to understand the underlying driver of your resistance can be insightful.

### Steps for Mindful Change Management {#steps-for-mindful-change-management}

1.  **Awareness of the change**

The first step is simply to recognize that things are changing. Gain as much information as possible regarding the change and what it might entail. Ideally, this process is done with a mind that accepts the reality of constant change, enabling curiosity, rather than fear, to be the driver behind the investigative process.

1.  **Awareness of your own resistance**

The second step is to be aware of any resistance to the change. If you think you don’t have any resistance, think again. It’s natural for us to resist change; there’s nothing wrong with resistance. Resistance can be very instructive and can help us gain insight into how to better manage the change. When you become aware of any resistance, don’t try to run from it or resist it.

1.  **Observation of your resistance**

The third step is to observe the resistance. Seek to understand where it comes from and what might be underlying it. See if there’s anything you can learn from it that might inform or enhance the change management process.

1.  **Mindfully choose your response**

With a solid understanding of the change and your resistance to it, you can choose a response. This may mean you choose to fully embrace the change and let go of any resistance. It may also mean you choose to try to skillfully influence the change process by mindfully presenting other alternatives. It may mean you choose not to accept the change because you realize it’s not in your best interest. Regardless of your choice, make the decision with a calm, clear mind.

1.  **Act**

The final step is to take action in accordance with your choices. This is where you move forward. Although this step will help you better manage the change process, that doesn’t mean it will be easy! It’s helpful to acknowledge that it will be difficult to change habitual patterns. You’ll likely have ongoing spikes of resistance and setbacks in the process. During this step, it’s important to both identify and accept the support you need to manage the change. This could be attending training, being coached, or practicing mindfulness.
