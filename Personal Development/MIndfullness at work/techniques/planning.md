## Planning {#planning}

Real planning requires slowing down, so that you can speed up. It’s an investment in time up front that has significant payback down the road.

Too often, instead of moving forward through intentional action, we end up stuck in place: working, acting, trying, but not making any real progress. The morning is the most important choice point of the day. As it sets the tone for the rest of the day, it’s critical to begin the morning with a period of clear planning.

### Clear Planning on a Daily Basis {#clear-planning-on-a-daily-basis}

When you get to work, make a habit of reserving the first ten minutes to do the following:

*   Do one to two minutes of ABCD mindfulness training to enhance your focus and subdue the impulse of action addiction.
*   Make a short list of the highest priority activities of the day—or review a list you made at the end of the previous day.
*   Plan your calendar for the day according to the highest priorities.
*   Now, get to work.
*   Review your plan once or twice during the day to track your progress.
*   **Weekly and monthly planning sessions can help you keep the big picture in mind and manage your calendar accordingly.**
*   **Allocate most of your time to completing activities that deliver the greatest outcomes for the least amount of effort.**
*   **Leave time for the urgent matters that will inevitably crop up. How much time you set aside for urgent matters depends on the nature of your work. Whatever you decide, saving a realistic margin of unscheduled time can help you avoid being put under unnecessary pressure.**
*   **Consider how much time you need to recharge your mental batteries every day—whether through small breaks, a short walk, or your ten minutes of mindfulness training.**
*   **Finally, make sure to reserve time for unavoidable “transition” activities, such as follow-up communication after meetings and travel.**
