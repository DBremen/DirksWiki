## Eating and Energy {#eating-and-energy}

To get the most out of mindful eating, there are three basic guidelines:

*   **Let Your Stomach Do the Eating**

A simple mindful tip for eating is to let your stomach do the eating. There’s no need to finish everything in front of you right this second.

*   **Avoid the Blood Sugar Rollercoaster**

Many of us, seeking a quick antidote to feeling sleepy, ride the blood sugar rollercoaster during the afternoon hours. An hour or two after lunch, we hit the afternoon slump—a fatigue our brains mis- takes for a lack of blood glucose. A natural and automatic reaction is to grab a snack, a cup of coffee, or an energy drink to quickly raise our energy levels. But a snack—and a sugary one in particular—can raise blood sugar levels too high, leading to mood swings, brain fog, and stress. After a short while, blood sugar levels plummet. A sense of panic results due to the stress, cortisol, and adrenaline released when fatigue and brain fog set in. Then we’re right back where we started, at the bottom of the roller coaster, with our brains craving another fix of fast energy.

*   **The Mindful Minute**

Over time, allowing you a mindful minute before immediately snacking can mitigate the general craving that comes with natural tiredness.

*   *   Next time you feel desire for food, pause.
    *   Allow yourself to mindfully observe the experience of desire.
    *   Allow the experience to be present, without engaging and giving in to it. This is not meant to impart strict discipline and impulse control, merely a moment of mindfulness before you eat. Ask yourself, what does it feel like? Where do you experience the feeling, in your stomach or elsewhere? Is the experience changing or does it stay the same?
    *   If after the minute, you’re feeling the same desire, you may actually be hungry. In that case, eat. If there’s little or no desire left, you weren’t actually hungry. Your brain tried to trick you. But you were smarter, and dismantled the desire by simply allowing it to rise without engaging in it.

**When you’re mindful of your food, awareness tells you when you have had enough. You tend to eat less. You also tend to enjoy food more, because you actually pay attention to it.**
