## Goals {#goals}

When you have clear goals, it’s far easier to stay focused and aware. Similarly, when you’re focused and aware, it’s easier to keep your actions aligned with your goals.

When it comes to maintaining clear goals, it’s important to manage both our conscious mind and our subconscious processes. Our sub- conscious is primarily driven by two simple motivations: grasping for things we like and avoiding things we don’t like. While our subconscious often craves short-term gratification, our conscious goals more often include delayed gratification.

The more mindful you are, the more bandwidth of conscious attention you have. Mindfulness increases the number of conscious bits you can process. At the same time, it gives you a better awareness of what’s happening in your subconscious mind. Mindfulness allows you to better align your conscious goals with your subconscious processes, keeping your goals center stage and enhancing your chances of success.

### Mindful Goal Orientation {#mindful-goal-orientation}

*   When you find yourself behaving counter to your goals, take a mindful pause (—focus on your breath as you calm down, gaining focus and clarity. This establishes your awareness.
*   Ask yourself the question “What stories, beliefs, or grasping or avoidance is keeping me from doing the thing that moves me closer to my goal?”
*   Whatever you find, face it and dismantle it by being present with it.
*   Adjust your behavior and move on.

### Mindful Goal Setting {#mindful-goal-setting}

*   Clearly defined and specific goals are easier for your subconscious to understand.
*   Positively framing your goals also makes it easier for your subconscious to process them. By default, the subconscious moves toward the desirable and away from the unpleasant.
*   Learning to hold our goals lightly, and let go of them if they won’t bring us long-term happiness, is an important skill.
