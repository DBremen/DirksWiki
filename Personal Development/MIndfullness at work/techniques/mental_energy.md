## Mental energy {#mental-energy}

When it comes to conserving mental energy, mindfulness can help in four key ways: being present, maintaining balance, making choices, and leveraging cycles.

*   **Being Present**

Being present in the here and now is a simple and easy way to conserve mental resources. When we allow our mind to wander aimlessly, it’s using up valuable energy that could be better used in other pursuits.

*   **Maintaining Balance**

Awareness of negative or positive thought spirals allows us to leverage balance. Being aware of the mind’s tendency to succumb to attraction or aversion—to run toward things we want or away from things we don’t want—is powerful.

*   **Making Choices**

Follow the first rule of mental effectiveness and choose a task and stick with it. Notice the impact that not jumping back and forth between tasks can have on your energy.

*   **Leveraging Cycles**

Our mental energy naturally ebbs and flows throughout the day, in cycles that have a lot to do with our sleep, nutrition, and level of physical activity. We simply are not always at peak mental performance. For most people, energy levels are higher first thing in the morning, after a good night’s rest. Those energy levels tend to decrease during the day, with a low point after lunch, before increasing again later in the afternoon. Being mindful of our how our energy levels fluctuate enables us to be strategic about what we do and when.
