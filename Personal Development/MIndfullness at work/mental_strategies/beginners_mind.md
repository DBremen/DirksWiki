## Beginners mind {#beginners-mind}

In my experience, looking anew is foundational for business success. Without the ability to do so, we default to yesterday’s perception of the market and the competition. We become complacent—and might just wake up to find ourselves behind the bus.

A few natural traits stand between each of us and a beginner’s mind: namely, habitual perception and cognitive rigidity.

The automatic association between what’s actually in front of you and what you’ve seen in the past—the neurological process called habitual perception—can be problematic. It means you often don’t actually see what’s right there in front of you. In fact, what you do see has much less to do with actual reality, and much more to do with the reality your mind creates based on your history and habits. In other words, you have programmed yourself to see reality in a certain way.

Cognitive rigidity—the inflexibility created by automatically recalling our habitual perceptions—is not conducive to creativity. It doesn’t help us innovate. Or help us to see new solutions to old challenges, let alone new solutions to new challenges.

The ability to face reality as it is—or at least not be stuck in old ways of seeing things—is the essence of a beginner’s mind. Without a beginner’s mind, we lock ourselves inside our own experience; we stagnate in our mind’s habitual perception. With a beginner’s mind, we see things with fresh eyes and an open mind.

Challenge yourself to be more curious in your day-to-day activities. Be open to what is happening to you moment to moment. The less you presume to know, the more your mind will open.
