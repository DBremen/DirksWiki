# Mindfulness {#mindfulness}

Mindfulness means trained attention. Based on thousands of years of practice, mindfulness techniques enable people to manage their attention, improve their awareness, and sharpen their focus and clarity.

**A mind in balance, which sees reality clearly and values ethics.**

Life is about results. Results come from our actions. Our actions come from the choices we make. Our choices come from the thoughts we think.

We are living in an “attention economy” where the ability to man- age our attention and the quality of our attention is key to our success. But in the digital age, where our ability to pay attention at will is under siege, we have a problem.

But from a neurological perspective, we’re not capable of focusing attention on two things at the same time. When we think we are multitasking, what we are doing in reality is shift-tasking : shifting attention rapidly between two or more things.

Mindfulness is about you. It’s about overcoming the multitasking trap, and entering the attention economy being one second ahead of your wandering mind and external distractions. It’s about generating greater mental effectiveness so that you can reach your full potential, both on a professional and a personal level. Effectiveness in this context is the ability to achieve your goals, objectives, and wishes in life.

The central characteristics of mindfulness are sharp focus and open awareness. Sharp focus is the ability to concentrate single-pointedly on any object of choice for a long as you want with minimal effort. Training sharp focus provides the benefit of being fully present with other people or tasks. Open awareness is the ability to see clearly what is happening in your mind and make wise choices about where to focus your attention. Through training open awareness, you gain clarity. The clutter from the outer world and from your own mind is reduced. As you become more insightful, even the most difficult problems appear less complex and become easier to handle. Optimal effectiveness is achieved when people are simultaneously sharply focused and openly aware.
