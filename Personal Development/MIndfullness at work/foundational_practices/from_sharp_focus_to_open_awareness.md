## From Sharp Focus to Open Awareness {#from-sharp-focus-to-open-awareness}

In training open awareness, as explored in the next chapter, you go a step further. During open awareness training, a sharpened focus helps generate insight into both the nature of the mind and how its performance can be optimized. With open awareness training, you develop a panoramic view that helps you see yourself, others, and every situation more objectively—allowing you to decide who and what gets your attention, and who and what does not.

Open awareness is the ability to observe your mind. It is training in becoming familiar with the workings of the mind and how that causes us to experience challenges in life. Open awareness helps you not be a victim of circumstance—only able to react automatically to situations as they develop. Open awareness involves training for a new kind of relationship with your thoughts and the world around you. It engenders certain clarity in the mind, allowing you to stay one second ahead of your reactions, regardless of the situation. With open awareness, autopilot is no longer the default response mechanism. Instead, it catalyzes the ability to relate to the events in your mind, bringing a whole new sense of clarity and direction into your life and work.

**Training open awareness provides you with the opportunity to experience, with a depth of understanding, that your thoughts are the root cause of your problems.**

Open awareness gives sharp focus direction and intentionality. Together, sharp focus and open awareness can help you spend your time, energy, and attention mindfully, ultimately increasing your effectiveness in life and work.

**The essence of open awareness training is observing your thoughts, senses, emotions and tasks in a neutral way—like a mental observatory.**

As in focus training, start by sitting comfortably, as described under the guidance in the “A” for Anatomy.

For a minute or two, direct your full attention toward your breathing, like in the focus training. Allow your mind to stabilize and settle. Count your breaths if it helps you let go of distractions. Check off one by one whether your mind has the three core qualities of relaxation, focus, and clarity.

When you’ve reached some level of these qualities, you can begin to open your awareness.

Let go of the attention on your breathing and open up to whatever may arise. When the first distraction attracts your attention—a sound, thought, physical sensation, or anything else—direct your full attention to it and use it as an anchor for your awareness.

Observe the distraction neutrally, just as you did with your breathing. Don’t think about it. Don’t engage in it. Don’t try to make it stay or go away. Simply observe it. If it helps, imagine observing the distractions as if they were waves on the beach.

Notice when the distraction comes into focus. Notice that it’s there. Notice when at some point it disappears or changes to something else.

When a distraction disappears, you open up and are ready to receive the next one in the same way. If a distraction changes into something else, you follow the transformation neutrally.

If at any point you find you’re confused or overwhelmed by your distractions, pause, relax, release the distractions, and return your focus to your breath. After a few moments, when you’ve stabilized your focus, let go of your breathing and open your awareness again.

At any time, you can always come back to the anchor and simply focus on your breath. Be prepared that you may need to come back to your breath again and again throughout your training to ensure you’re not getting carried away by thoughts and distractions.

If it’s difficult to have a neutral approach to the distraction, that is, if you notice you start to engage with it, it can be helpful to give it a short mental label. For example, if a thought arises about something you need to buy, you can label it “shopping” and observe the experience of the thought without thinking about what it is and where you will get it. You can also use even simpler labels such as “thought,” “sensation,” and “feeling,” without qualifiers.

While the instructions are simple, the challenge for many is observing thoughts, feelings, sensations, and emotions neutrally without engaging. In fact, many find training open awareness difficult, especially in the beginning.

**Use open awareness as a basis for your training for a couple of weeks as you develop your ability to be a neutral observer of your thoughts and experiences. When you feel able to respond to distractions deliberately rather than react automatically, you can move to the next level of open awareness training that includes the three insights outlined below.**

### Insight #1: Everything Changes {#insight-1-everything-changes}

Rationally, we understand that even the most frustrating situation will eventually change. Even so, the mind has a tendency to hold on to difficult situations as if they will always be there.

The first insight of open awareness is about developing an instinctive understanding that everything changes, that everything is transitory. Everything. The more you come to grasp, in a meaningful way, the fact that everything changes, the easier it becomes to deal with negative things, because you know they will change. You will also place a higher value on the positive things you experience, appreciating them more while they last. In your training, and in life, when observing your distractions, regardless of what they are, ask yourself the following questions:

Is there anything you experience that is unchanging?

Is there a thought that never goes away?

Is there anything solid and static, or is it all a process?

### Insight #2: Happiness Is a Choice {#insight-2-happiness-is-a-choice}

Similarly, the situations we experience don’t cause frustration or anger on their own. Rather, it’s the way we relate to our surroundings that creates the problems we perceive in life. Regardless of external circumstances, we are the source of our own happiness or frustration. By changing our worldview, we have the potential to free ourselves from the problems we create.

**“We all have two wolves inside us. One is bad and feels anger, jealousy, envy, falsehoods, and arrogance. The other is good and feels love, empathy, honesty, generosity, and humility. The two wolves constantly fight each other.” One of the grandchildren asks, “But which one wins?” “The one you feed,” the old man answers.**

### Insight #3: Everything Is Potential {#insight-3-everything-is-potential}

The insight that everything is potential and that there is no solid, isolated self means we can redefine ourselves. We can break free of our own limited definitions of ourselves and others. New possibilities open up in every situation we encounter. Nothing is fixed. We have the choice to define all people and all situations based on our perspectives, however narrow or expansive they may be. When everything is potential, it offers each and every one of us an abundance of opportunities and positive outcomes.
