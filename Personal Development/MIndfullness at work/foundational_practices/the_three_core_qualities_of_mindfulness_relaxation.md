### Overcome Tension with Relaxation {#overcome-tension-with-relaxation}

When you practice mindfulness, you may find yourself caught up in this neurological “performance mode.” It may seem almost unnatural to sit still, especially with so many tasks that need to be done. In the spirit of performance, you may push yourself to follow training instructions with- out truly understanding their greater purpose. But wanting to be “good at” mindfulness so you can get it over with—and assume the benefits of a high-performing mind as soon as possible—won’t get you very far.

When you breathe in, scan your body to identify points where you are experiencing tension. When you breathe out, pay attention to that point and allow the tension to release.

Keep in mind the following definition: “Relaxation is the absence of unnecessary effort.” Scan your body for any unnecessary effort and gently let it go.

Scan and release tension in your body for the first minute of your training or as long as it takes to increase your ability to be alert but relaxed. In this way you will gradually develop a more relaxed body and mind.
