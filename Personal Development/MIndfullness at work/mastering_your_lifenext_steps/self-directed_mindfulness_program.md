## Self-Directed Mindfulness Program {#self-directed-mindfulness-program}

The following are the most basic guidelines for a ten week self-directed training program.

Each week you:

Undertake ten minutes of sharp focus or open awareness training on a daily basis;

Select a mental strategy from Part II;

Select one or two workplace techniques from Part I.

This program begins with focus training because it’s the foundation for all the other elements. Only after you’ve developed a substantial level of focus—typically after four to five weeks of daily training— should you move on to awareness training. After the ten weeks, you’ll have experienced both types of training and can choose the one you prefer.
