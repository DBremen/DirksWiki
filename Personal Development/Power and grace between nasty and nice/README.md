# Power and grace between nasty and nice {#power-and-grace-between-nasty-and-nice}

Chapter 17 414

The “power and grace between nasty or nice” refers to the challenge facing each of us to find the balanced area that rests between being too nasty or too nice.

**Someone who is overly dependent is just as dysfunctional as one who is overly independent.**

People who believe that their emotions should always be expressed and routinely acted upon are at very high risk for doing great harm to their partners and ruining their romantic relationships. Emotions need to be expressed. There can be no emotional connection between people without that. But emotions also need to be contained at times. The belief that “if I feel it, I should act on it” is a dangerous one unless it is also tempered by a parallel belief that “**I must evaluate which feelings to express, how to appropriately express them, and which ones to contain.” Otherwise, we are nothing more than wild animals acting out our primitive impulses.**

Care is simple. It is kind. It is gracious. It is one human being seeing another human being and taking the time to acknowledge what one sees**. It is taking the time to listen without trying to fix, rescue, analyze, problem-solve, or therapize.**

**The health of a marriage depends on the balance of power and control within both partners, and between both partners. If I don’t control my impulses enough, I will overpower you. If you don’t exert your power enough, you will disappear.**

**There Are Always Reasons and Payoffs for Our Unhealthy Behaviors; Otherwise We Wouldn’t Engage in Them—Be Honest About What Those Reasons Are**

**Talking about feelings isn’t the same as expressing them.**

You know you are becoming a competent, healthy adult when you can choose what at times will be the exquisite pain and discomfort of fear, hurt, shame, loneliness, and sadness rather than hurt yourself, hurt others, or let others hurt you. the ability to self-regulate is especially important in the functioning of a healthy person, family, or society, and it is impossible to have deep relationships unless one can sit in the middle of one’s loneliness, fear, hurt, shame, and sadness without acting out.

Every human being is vastly capable of being both nasty and nice at various times throughout our lives.

Our capacity for forgiveness and our capacity to make amends are boundless, if we let them be.

What makes us spiritual beings is our ability to look back at what we have done to each other and to consider, with the wisdom of experience and age, how what seemed “normal” back then now seems cruel and inconsiderate; and then to have the chance to repair those wrongs or to forgive those wrongs done to us by others.

Self-esteem = competence and acceptance + belonging
