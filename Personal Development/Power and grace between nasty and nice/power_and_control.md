# Power and control {#power-and-control}

Power is the capacity to influence.

Control can be defined most simply as a reciprocal to power, that is, as the capacity to restrain or regulate influence.

**People who have learned to combine grace and power spend the majority of their time engaging in neither of these painful patterns of behavior. They find ways to meet their needs and the needs of their families while remaining socially appropriate, respectful, and kind; while having personal integrity and decency; and yet the individuals involved remain powerful, competent, and effective.**

**The human experience of power/control is the experience of living as a self interacting with a world. . . . If control becomes excessive in a relationship, the opportunity for individual self-expression or self-actualization is reduced; when power dominates, the stage is set for competition and conflict. In human interactions that are positive and effective, a balance of power/control is achieved. The result is an experience of mutuality regulation is a shared endeavor. In the experience of mutuality, each individual can retain a sense of self-identity and worth while simultaneously feeling connected and even intimate with others as part of a larger relationship system.**
