# Position Velocity Acceleration {#position-velocity-acceleration}

### Position {#position}

Distance is a scalar (how much have you moved?) and displacement is a vector (since it also includes the direction of the movement):

While both friends walk different differences they both have the same displacement since they end up in the same place.

### Velocity {#velocity}

Change in position per unit of time (5m/5s = 1m/s)

Speed is a scalar (since it only describes the magnitude) and velocity is a vector (since it describes the magnitude and the direction)

Velocity can also be negative

### Acceleration {#acceleration}

Change in velocity over time:

*   Start velocity = 0 m/s
*   End velocity = 5 m/s
*   Time 5 s
*   5m/s per 5s
*   = = 1m/s<sup>2</sup>

Acceleration is a vector and can be positive or negative (negative acceleration will point backwards)
