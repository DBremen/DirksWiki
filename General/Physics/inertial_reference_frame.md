# Inertial reference frame {#inertial-reference-frame}

When we measure movements we just measure them relative to the earth. Assuming as if the earth would stand still and not fly through the universe.

The earth is in this case used as an inertial reference frame (we pretend it does not move).

**When we move with a constant velocity (no acceleration or deceleration) in a straight line we are not able to distinguish whether we move or not.**

**If you throw a ball up into the air while you are on a train. To you it will feel as if the ball goes up and down in a straight line. From the perspective of the train the ball has no horizontal velocity.**

**From the perspective of someone standing outside the train the ball will move in a curve since from their inertial reference frame there is a horizontal velocity which is the speed of the train.**
