# Temperature and heat {#temperature-and-heat}

Temperature -&gt; the amount of heat energy available for work in a system this relates to the average kinetic energy of the molecules in the system

Higher temperature = faster moving particles. A hot object will have kinetic energy more faster which means moving particles.

Heat moves from hot to cold. Substances do not contain heat, heat is a transfer of internal energy

To make an engine more efficient one needs to increase the heat difference between the engine (heat source) and the cooler surroundings
