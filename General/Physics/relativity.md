Special relativity = E=mc<sup>2</sup>

Gravity = curvature of space-time

More gravity = slower time -&gt; clocks on mountains tick faster

Approaching the **speed of light**, a person inside a spaceship would age much **slower** than his twin at home. Even at the &quot;low **speed**&quot; of 10% of the **speed of light** (300,000 km per second, or 186,300 miles per second) our clocks **would slow down** by only around 1%, but if we travel at 95% of the **speed of light time** will **slow down** to about one-third of that measured by a stationary observer.

The satellite clocks are moving at 14,000 km/hr in orbits that circle the Earth twice per day, much faster than clocks on the surface of the Earth, and Einstein&#039;s theory of special relativity says that rapidly moving clocks tick more slowly, by about seven microseconds (millionths of a second) per day.

Also, the orbiting clocks are 20,000 km above the Earth, and experience gravity that is four times weaker than that on the ground. Einstein&#039;s general relativity theory says that gravity curves space and time, resulting in a tendency for the orbiting clocks to tick slightly faster, by about 45 microseconds per day. The net result is that time on a GPS satellite clock advances faster than a clock on the ground by about 38 microseconds per day.

Additive and subtractive property of speed

If A throws a ball to B while B is running towards A the speed of the B (W) is added to the speed of the ball

V

A B

W

V+W

If A throws a ball to B while B is running away from A the speed of the B (W) is subtracted from the speed of the ball

V

A B

W

V-W

Since the speed of light is constant the equivalent formulas need to be adjusted considering special relativity:

V+W = if V = speed of light C+W = = c [https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28c%2Bw%29%2F%281%2Bcw%2Fc%5E2%29](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28c%2Bw%29%2F%281%2Bcw%2Fc%5E2%29)

V-W = =

Treaty ceremony two presidents only want to sign a treaty at the same time. Therefore it has been decided that they sign only if the light from a light bulb that sits on a table that they sit the same distance away from reaches their eye while sitting in a train.

For observers that stand outside the train (while itâ€™s moving), the light does not reach the eyes of the presidents at the same time since the movement of the train moves towards the president on the left hand-side (train is moving from left to right).

Time difference (from perspective of platform):

L = Length of train

V = speed of train

F = president forward land

B = president backward land

t<sub>F</sub>= time it takes the light to reach F

t<sub>B</sub>= time it takes the light to reach B

Distance travelled for B = L/2 + V t<sub>B</sub>

Distance travelled for F = L/2 - V t<sub>F</sub>

c t<sub>B</sub>= L/2 + V t<sub>B =</sub> L/2 (C-V)

c t<sub>F</sub> = L/2 (C+V)

Time difference =
