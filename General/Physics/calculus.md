Rates of change and their accumulation over time

Velocity = x/t = slope of line

One could look at short parts of the line and approximate those as straight lines and measure their slopes.

Limit = infinitely zooming in

Can also be imagined by using discrete time steps:

Integral = opposite e.g. measure position based on velocity per time:

Measure the area under the curve
