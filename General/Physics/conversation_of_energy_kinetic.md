# Conversation of energy (kinetic) {#conversation-of-energy-kinetic}

Momentum = mass * velocity (mv) (kg*m/s)

Momentum -&gt; Quantity of motion present in a body.

Kinetic energy = ½ * mass * (velocity)<sup>2</sup>

Kinetic energy -&gt; the work needed to accelerate a body of a given mass from rest to its stated velocity.

Kinetic energy = accumulated momentum as velocity changes : mv vs. ½ * mv<sup>2</sup>

There are different types of energy:

#### Kinetic energy {#kinetic-energy}

Kinetic energy -&gt; The energy an object possesses by virtue of its motion

W = Fd

F = ma

W = mad

#### Potential energy {#potential-energy}

The energy an object possesses by virtue of it position in a field.

If you a lift a ball into the air, the higher you lift it the more you will increase its gravitational potential energy. If you drop the ball from a height the potential gravitational energy is converted into kinetic energy. The closer an object is to the gravitational center of the earth the less potential energy it has.

Also a compressed spring or a bow in an arrow has that potential energy (elastic potential energy)

Gravitational potential energy:

PE = mgh kg * 9.81 m/s<sup>2</sup> * height in meters
