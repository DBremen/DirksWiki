## Projectile motion {#projectile-motion}

An object moves along a curved path, which can be described as a parabola under the influence of gravity. The horizontal and vertical motion are independent of each other and are also measured independently:

E.g. if one marble is pushed from a table (with some force in the horizontal direction) and another is just dropped from the same height. Their y-direction velocities and time in the air are identical.

Inertial reference frame

How long does it take for the rock to hit the ground? (only dependent on y-direction e.g. gravity)

How far away from the cliff will it land? (dependent on both vectors)

Horizontal velocity will be constant but vertical velocity will decrease

**Initial velocities in x and y directions**

Cos 30 degrees = adj./hyp.

Vx = adj.

Vx = Cos 30 degress * hyp.

Vx = Cos 30 deg. * 8.5 m/s

Vx = 7.36 m/s

Vy = opposite

Sin 30 deg. = Vy / hyp.

Vy = Sin 30 deg. * 8.5 m/s

Vy = 4.25 m/s

Time in the air = y-direction

-100m = (4.25 m/s) t + .5 (-9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup>)t<sup>2</sup>

**t = 4.97 s**

Distance travelled

Since there is no horizontal acceleration (a) the formula can be simplified to:x = v<sub>i</sub> * t

= 7.36 m/s * 4.97s

**36.6 m**
