## Vertical motion {#vertical-motion}

Positive = upwards, negative = downwards

Acceleration = gravity = -9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup>

Unique to earth:

*   Mass = 6 * 10<sup>24</sup> kg
*   Radius = 6.4 * 10<sup>6</sup> m

Drop a rock from 100m

How long was the rock in the air?

What was the velocity upon the impact?

t<sup>2</sup> = (x<sub>t</sub> â€“ x<sub>0</sub>) / .5 * a

t<sup>2</sup> = -100m / -4.9m/s<sup>2</sup>

**t = 4.52 s**

v<sub>f</sub> = -9.8m/s<sup>2</sup> * 4.52s

v<sub>f</sub> = -**44.1 m/s**
