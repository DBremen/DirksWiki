## Horizontal motion {#horizontal-motion}

A car accelerates from standing with 2.5 m/s<sup>2</sup>s. What is the velocity and the distance after 10 seconds?

Acceleration on an inclined plane height = H and length = L: acceleration = **gH/L**

If the plane is 90 degrees H/L = 1 and a=g (g = acceleration of body in free fall)

**g = aL/H**

**Velocity = a*t**; acceleration * time (m/s<sup>2</sup> * s = m/s)

Average velocity = start velocity + end velocity / 2

If start velocity = 0 then average velocity = at/2

**Distance =**

v = 0 + 2.5 m/s<sup>2</sup> * 10s = **25 m/s**

x = 0m + 0 m/s<sup>2</sup> + .5 * 2.5m/s<sup>2</sup> * (10 s)<sup>2</sup>

x = .5 * 2.5 * 100 = **125 m**

Car is driving at 27 m/s you hit the brakes with deceleration of -8.4 m/s<sup>2</sup>. How long will it take to stop and how long is the braking distance?

t = (v<sub>t</sub> â€“ v<sub>i</sub>) / a

t = 0 - 27 m/s / -8.4 m/s<sup>2</sup>

t = 27/8.4 s = **3.2 s**

x = 0 + 27 m/s * 3.2 s + .5 * -8.4 m/s<sup>2</sup> * (3.2) s <sup>2</sup>

x = 86.4 m + .5 * -86.02

x = **43.4 m**

You are riding your bike downtown at a speed of 15 m/s and you see a red light ahead. You gently brake over a distance of 50 m and come to a complete stop. What is your acceleration during this time?

a = (v<sub>f</sub><sup>2</sup> - v<sub>i</sub><sup>2</sup>)/2d

a = -15m/s<sup>2</sup>/2*50m

a = -225 m<sup>2</sup>/s<sup>2</sup>/100m

a = -2.25 m/s<sup>2</sup>
