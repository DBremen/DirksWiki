# Kinematics {#kinematics}

Galileo discovered that the distance an object falls is proportional to the square root of time:

E.g. if the object travels 1m in 1s it will travel 4m in 2s and 16m in 4s.

Furthermore the acceleration that is acted upon the object is gravity which is on earth 9.81 m/s<sup>2</sup>

Gravity speeds up a falling object by 9.81m/s for every seconds it drops

after one second, an object will have fallen a distance of 1/2 × 9.8 × 1<sup>2</sup> = 4.9 m. After two seconds it will have fallen 1/2 × 9.8 × 2<sup>2</sup> = 19.6 m. 4.6 * 4 = 19.6m

### Fundamental kinematic equations: {#fundamental-kinematic-equations}

Velocity at time t = initial velocity + acceleration x time

Additional derived equations

d = displacement (positional change in a direction)

v = velocity (speed + direction)

a = acceleration (will be always constant)

t = time
