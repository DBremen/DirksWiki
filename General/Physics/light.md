But what is this light? Light is simply perpendicular waves in the electrical and magnetic fields. When one goes up and down, the other goes left and right. Together they are called an electromagnetic wave, or EM wave. EM waves include the X-rays fired at you by your doctor, the microwaves heating your left overs, the radio waves bringing you your favorite tunes, the light detected by your eye, etc. Itâ€™s all the same stuff, the only differences being its wavelength, which is the distance between each crest or trough, and its frequency, which is the rate at which it oscillates.

**The higher the temperature, the shorter the wavelength and therefore the higher the frequency.** Blue stars appear blue because they are hotter and emit most of their light in the blue part of the visible spectrum. And red stars are red because they are cooler and emit a majority of red light.

Infra red = beyond red = long wave length (heat camera even longer and micro-waves -&gt; radio waves)

Ultra violet = very violet = short wave length (x-ray even shorter)

Color is seen by different objects absorbing certain parts of the light and reflecting the remainder of the spectrum.
