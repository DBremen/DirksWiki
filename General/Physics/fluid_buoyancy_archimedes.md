# Fluid buoyancy Archimedes {#fluid-buoyancy-archimedes}

Liquids and gases are both fluids

Density = mass / volume

Buoyancy = upward force exerted on an object by a fluid it is submerged into

An object floats if its density is lower than that of water (1g/cm<sup>3</sup>). Because the displaced water by the object is of the same volume as the object but has more weight therefore producing a greater buoyancy force than the objectâ€™s weight. This is because a submerged object will experience a buoyant force equal to the weight of the displaced fluid.

A floating object displaces fluid based on its mass. (Water level/buoyancy based on mass)

A sinking object displaces fluid based on its volume. (Water level rises based on volume)
