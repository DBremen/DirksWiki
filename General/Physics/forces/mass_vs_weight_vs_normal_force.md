## Mass vs. Weight vs normal force {#mass-vs-weight-vs-normal-force}

Mass is a scalar in kg = the amount of matter an object contains

Weight is a vector (having magnitude and direction)

Weight -&gt; The force exerted on an object by virtue of its position in a gravitational field. The force with which a body is attracted to the earth.

Objects and mass are proportional (object with more mass will weigh more)

Weight -&gt; F = ma where a = gravity on earth (W=mg) mass * gravity

Weight = 100kg * 9.81 m/s<sup>2</sup> = 981 Newton

Mass will not change but the weight changes depending on location (outside earth)

### Normal force {#normal-force}

Is the force opposite to weight. It is exerted by whatever surface an object sits on and it points in the direction that is perpendicular to the surface. On a flat horizontal surface the normal force directly opposes weight (they both have the same magnitude) and the object will remain still.
