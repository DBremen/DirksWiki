## Friction {#friction}

A surface exerts two forces on a moving object. Normal force (see above) and the frictional force which acts perpendicular to movement of the object in the opposite direction.

Static friction resists the initiation of motion. The static friction increases as more force is applied to an object in order to move it. The friction will increase (it will equal the applied moving force) until its maximum before the object starts moving.

Each surface has a different friction coefficient, the max force to move an object can be calculated as follows:

Kinetic friction resists the motion of a moving object

Kinetic friction is less than static friction

Air and water also have friction
