## Work and Energy {#work-and-energy}

### Work {#work}

Work -&gt; Action done on an object that displaces the object.

**W = Fd** (Force * displacement magnitude) e.g. (100 N)(10 m) = **1000 Nm = 1000 J (joules)**

only the component of force parallel to the displacement counts towards work (e.g. Fx)

Work can also be negative if the work applied is in the opposite direction of the movement of the object.

### Energy {#energy}

Energy -&gt; The capacity to do work
