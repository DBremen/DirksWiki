## Newton’s 3<sup>rd</sup> law of motion {#newton-s-3rd-law-of-motion}

For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction

Whenever a body exerts a force on a second body, the second body exerts a force on the first body. The forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

If every force involves an equal and opposite counterforce why don’t the two forces always cancel out by vector addition? This happens only when they are exerted on the same body. The law of interaction involves equal and opposite forces exerted on two separate bodies. If you push a rock the rock also pushes you in the opposite direction ( usually this is not noticeable because of friction between your shoes and the ground). (The horse is pulling the wagon and the wagon pulls the horse.)
