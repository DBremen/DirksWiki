## Newtonâ€™s 1<sup>st</sup> law of motion (law of inertia) {#newton-s-1st-law-of-motion-law-of-inertia}

An object at rest will remain at rest and an object in motion will remain in motion unless acted upon by some external net force.

Objects with a greater mass have a higher inertia, it is harder to move and stop them from moving.

In space there is almost no friction or wind therefore objects move with a constant velocity in space unless they are accelerated or decelerated or affected by other forces (e.g. gravitation pull of a planet)
