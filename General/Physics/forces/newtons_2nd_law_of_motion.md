## Newton’s 2<sup>nd</sup> law of motion {#newton-s-2nd-law-of-motion}

Describes what will happen if there is indeed a net force (sum of vectors of forces will be positive).

F = ma ; force = mass x accelation

If no (net) force is applied to an object: ma = 0

Since every object has a mass != 0 it follows that a must be 0 (m*0=0). If no net force acts on a body it undergoes no acceleration and must therefore be either at rest or travelling at a constant velocity.

The above is an expression of Newton’ s 1\. law and proves that the 1\. law is just a special case of the 2<sup>nd</sup> law of motion.

Bigger mass requires more force to achieve the same acceleration:

1m/s<sup>2</sup> = 25 N / 25 kg; 1m/s<sup>2</sup> = 5 N / 5 kg
