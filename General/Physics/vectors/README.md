# Vectors {#vectors}

Forces are drawn as arrows with an angle pointing in the direction of the force or symbolized as a letter with an arrow on top of it. The length of the arrow indicates the magnitude of the force.

If multiple forces act on an object operation on the vectors need to be carried out in order to calculate the forces.
