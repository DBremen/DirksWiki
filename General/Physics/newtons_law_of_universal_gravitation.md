# Newton’s law of universal gravitation {#newton-s-law-of-universal-gravitation}

When a canon is fired with greater force it hits the ground later. If a canon could be fired with a great force it would never hit the ground since its velocity would counter the gravitational force and orbit around the earth.

A satellite maintains its orbit by balancing two factors: its velocity (the speed it takes to travel in a straight line since objects in a vacuum keep going in straight line) and the gravitational pull that Earth has on it. A satellite orbiting closer to the Earth requires more velocity to resist the stronger gravitational pull.

Since F = ma

a = f/m = G * m/r<sup>2</sup>

F<sub>G</sub> = Gravitational force between to objects

m<sub>1</sub> = mass of first object

r = radius = distance between the two object’s centre of gravity.

Earth and moon exert the same gravitational force at each other

The earth-moon system rotate around its center of mass (which lies within earth but not its center)

Since F=ma and a = f/m the moon is moving much faster than the earth. More massive objects have more inertia, or resistance to being accelerated.

The gravitational force decreases with the inverse square of distance. The moon is roughly 60 times further from the center of the earth than something on the surface of the earth and therefore the gravitational force is 60*60 weaker.

Gravity on earth decreases with altitude but even more so the closer you move towards the equator since the shape of the earth bulges towards its centre due to centrifugal forces (as if you squash a soft ball)

Therefore, the gravitational force is stronger at the poles than (9.82) than at the equator (9.79)
