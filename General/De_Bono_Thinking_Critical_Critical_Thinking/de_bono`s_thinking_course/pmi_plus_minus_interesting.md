## PMI (Plus Minus Interesting) {#pmi-plus-minus-interesting}

*   The PMI is an attention directing tool. Direct your attention to plus, minus and interesting points about a subject in order one after the other over a period of 2-3 minutes. Rather than to focus on defending one`s prejudged opinion by collecting pro`s and con`s.(Reacting and justifying your reaction)
*   Instead of intelligence being used to prejudice the matter decision can be made afterwards. Emotions are now applied after the exploration phase.
*   In PMI we are not looking to assign values to the points. We look in one direction after the other (scanning) and note down what we see (church in the north and in the south)
*   You can ask a person to do a PMI when there seems to be prejudged reaction to a situation

Practice questions:

Should everyone wear a badge showing his or her mood?
