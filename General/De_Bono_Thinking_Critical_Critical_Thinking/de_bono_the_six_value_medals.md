# De Bono: The Six Value Medals {#de-bono-the-six-value-medals}

In a way, a perception is an unconscious about how we see the world around us. Because they are unconscious we have no control over our perceptions unless we make the driving values visible.

Logic can help you to decide how to do something but logic cannot tell you what you want to do. The difficulty is that any decision made on a value basis can always be “rationalized” in hindsight as being made on a purely logical basis. We can seek to rationalize a bad decision made purely on an emotional basis. If we are good at rationalizing we may not realize just how bad the decision really is. If we come to believe that our decisions are entirely logical, the greater danger is that we then neglect to pay attention to our values and may not even realize how they affect our decisions.

Values are the underlying drivers that bring about our emotions.
