## Capitalize on feedback {#capitalize-on-feedback}

While the value of feedback is high, the incentive to give feedback to others is low—and the actual desire to hear it is often nonexistent. After all, the work you do to pursue your ideas is a labor of love. The last thing anyone wants is to hear harsh truths about a loved one.

### Start/Stop/Continue {#start-stop-continue}

*   Send an e-mail to each team member/stakeholder requesting a few feedback points for each participant under the headings START, STOP, and CONTINUE
*   Each recipient is asked to share a few things that each of their colleagues and clients should START, STOP, and CONTINUE doing
*   People then return their lists to the team’s leader (except for the feedback about the leader, which is redirected to someone else on the team)
*   The points under each heading are aggregated to identify the larger trends
*   Isolated points mentioned by only one person are discarded
*   Common themes are then shared in a personal meeting with each member of the team.

This method not only serve to gather intelligence in the course of making ideas happen but also send a message to your community of collaborators and clients. The message suggests that you are open to feedback, that you are constantly improving, and that you are actively learning.
