## Self-Leadership {#self-leadership}

As you lead others in creative pursuits, you are your greatest liability. Self-leadership is about awareness, tolerance, and not letting your own natural tendencies limit your potential. Our best hope for staying on track is to notice when we stray and to figure out why—to be self-aware. Self-awareness is a critical skill in leadership, but it is deeply personal. It is not about our actions but about the emotions that trigger our actions. With increased self-awareness, we become better students of ourselves. When we make mistakes, we are able to identify what we could have done better more readily. When we receive feedback from others, it becomes more actionable as we come to understand its correlation with our emotions. The path to self-awareness never ends, but we must traverse it nonetheless. Emerging leaders in the creative world benefit from some sort of psychological development in their lives. An early commitment to developing self-awareness will yield better judgment. In turn, sound judgment builds lasting relationships and great decisions —the kind that garner the respect and confidence you need to lead bold pursuits.
