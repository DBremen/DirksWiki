## Focus and staying on track vs. new ideas/innovation {#focus-and-staying-on-track-vs-new-ideas-innovation}

The great challenge is to balance idea generation and relentless focus. While you don’t want to behave like a large company that locks down all creativity from the point of production, you also don’t want to act like a fledgling start-up that is always generating new ideas and features that saturate the project, ultimately getting in the way of execution. Finding the right balance requires allocating time for open idea exchange along with a healthy level of intolerance for idea generation during execution. One approach is to have a bias toward considering ideas during brainstorming sessions and killing ideas when they come up randomly during execution. Your resident skeptics can be helpful on this front. Of course, great ideas may still crop up unexpectedly, but when they do your bias should be to stay focused on the project at hand. With this approach, only the mightiest of ideas—those worthy of deep consideration—will risk getting you off track.
