## Getting Information Into and Out of Long-Term Memory {#getting-information-into-and-out-of-long-term-memory}

**The key factor in transferring information from short-term to long-term memory is the development of associations between the new information and schemata already available in memory**. This, in turn, depends upon two variables: the extent to which the information to be learned relates to an already existing schema, and the level of processing given to the new information. Depth (level) of processing refers to the amount of effort and cognitive capacity employed to process information, and the number and strength of associations that are thereby forged between the data to be learned and knowledge already in memory.

The following illustrative tasks are listed in order of the depth of mental processing required:

1.  Say how many letters there are in each word on the list
2.  Give a word that rhymes with each word
3.  Make a mental image of each word, make up a story that incorporates each word.

**Memory Rarely Changes Retroactively.**

Memories are seldom reassessed or reorganized retroactively in response to new information. For example, information that is dismissed as unimportant or irrelevant because it did not fit an analystâ€™s expectations does not become more memorable even if the analyst changes his or her thinking to the point where the same information, received today, would be recognized as very significant.
