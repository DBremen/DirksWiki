# The Psychology of Intelligence Analysis: {#the-psychology-of-intelligence-analysis}

What people in general perceive, and how readily they perceive it, are strongly influenced by their past experience, education, cultural values, and role requirements, as well as by the stimuli recorded by their receptor organs.

**We tend to perceive what we expect (rather than what we want) to perceive**

Objectivity is achieved by making basic assumptions and reasoning as explicit as possible so that they can be challenged by others and analysts can, themselves, examine their validity.

**Mind-sets tend to be quick to form but resistant to change.**

**New information is assimilated (combined/integrated) to existing images.** **The receipt of information in small increments over time also facilitates assimilation.**

**Counter measures**

*   **Encourage analysis that clearly outline their assumptions and chains of inference and that specify the degree and source of uncertainty involved in the conclusions.**
*   **Support analyses that periodically re-examine key problems from the ground up in order to avoid the pitfalls of the incremental approach.**
*   **Emphasize procedures (like brainstorming) that expose and elaborate alternative points of view.**
