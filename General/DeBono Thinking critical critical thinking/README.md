# DeBono Thinking critical critical thinking {#debono-thinking-critical-critical-thinking}

&quot;Say what you mean and mean what you say&quot; is a sound principle of critical thinking (and of personal integrity, for that matter).

*   We must be idealistic (and thus capable of imagining a better world).
*   We must be realistic (and thus see things as they are).
*   We must be pragmatic (and thus adopt effective measures for moving toward our ideals).
