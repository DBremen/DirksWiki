## Lateral thinking {#lateral-thinking}

_“The vertical thinker says: ‘I know what lam looking for.’ The lateral thinker says: ‘I am looking but I won’t know what I am looking for until I have found it.’”_

Lateral thinking is both an attitude of mind and also a number of defined methods. The attitude of mind involves the willingness to try to look at things in different ways. It involves an appreciation that any way of looking at things is only one amongst many possible ways. It involves an understanding of how the mind uses patterns and the need to escape from an established pattern to switch into a better one.

Vertical thinking is analytical, lateral thinking is provocative

Lateral thinking has to do with change, especially when change involves escaping from a pattern that has been satisfactory in the past. The usual method of change is through criticism and attack. The weakness of that method is that we can only consider change when a concept can be shown to be inadequate and when the attacking party has the power to carry through the change.

It may be necessary to be on the top of a mountain in order to find the best way up. With vertical thinking one has to be correct at every step, with lateral thinking one does not have to be

**Hindsight and insight**: We switch to a new pattern and suddenly see that something is reasonable and obvious. In hindsight any creative idea must be logical – otherwise we could never accept it as having a value. The mistake we make is to assume that since it is logical in hindsight then the better exercise of logic could have got us there in the first place. Lateral thinking seeks to achieve the pattern-switching that occurs in insight.

### Creative hit list {#creative-hit-list}

This is a formal target list of focuses that need creative thinking. The list would be available on bulletin boards or a website.

The Creative Hit List provides a target and a demand. You are expected to have ideas about the items on the list. You may even be specifically asked to have an idea on a particular item by a particular date. A team may be assigned a task from the list and asked to report back on a given date.

The list may be changed but some items may be more permanent. There should be about 10 items on the list. The List provides a permanent background demand that emphasizes that creativity is always needed.

### Concepts {#concepts}

You can identify the concept that seems to be in use and then seek to find other ways of delivering the same concept.

*   There can be operational or functional concepts. These describe the way something is done.
*   There can be value concepts. Why this is of value.
*   There can be purpose concepts. Why we are doing this.
*   There can be descriptive concepts covering a whole range of things that seem to have something in common.

Concept extraction:

We seek to develop alternatives and new ideas by &#039;extracting the concept&#039; and then looking around for other ways to deliver this concept by means of a specific idea.

Take a piece of paper and a pen. You start with the defined purpose of what you are trying to achieve at the right-hand side of the page. **For example, you might set out &#039;traffic congestion in cities&#039;.** The implied purpose is how to deal with the problem of traffic congestion in cities. In your diagram, everything will need to flow or cascade from this point on the paper.

The next level lays out the broad concepts, or &#039;thinking directions&#039;, which might help tackle the problem. These might be:

1.  reduce traffic
2.  improve traffic flow
3.  increase travel space.

We then move backwards (towards the right-hand side of the page) to list the more specific concepts that could operate the broad concepts.

1.1 For &#039;reducing traffic&#039; we might have: restrict the number of vehicles; discourage traffic; reduce the need to travel; multi-user vehicles.

2.1 For &#039;improving traffic flow&#039; we might have: deal with peak travel 

We then take each of the specific concepts and see how this could be put into action with specific ideas.

1.1.1 For &#039;restricting the number of vehicles&#039; we might have: high entry tolls; vehicle purchase permission auction (as in Singapore); special city access licenses.

1.1.2 For &#039;discouraging traffic&#039; we might have: high congestion charges for entering the city (as in London); no provision for parking; poor-quality

### Stepping stone {#stepping-stone}

Movement is for moving across channels. We use judgment for staying within existing channels but are also able to use movement when we want to change patterns.

In the judgment idiom, when we come to an idea which is wrong we dismiss it and back away. In the movement idiom we use the idea as a stepping stone to help us move to a different pattern. It means using the idea to see where it leads to. It is not that we treat a bad idea as a good idea.

When one Jumps right to the solution then the soundness of that solution obviously cannot depend on the soundness of the path by which it was reached. Nevertheless the solution may still make sense in its own right without having to depend on the pathway by which it was reached. 

### Po provocation operation {#po-provocation-operation}

Self-organizing systems tend to settle down in a stable equilibrium, which is called a local equilibrium. They remain in that state until provocation moves them towards a more global equilibrium. What is important is that the provocation is meant to be a provocation. It is never meant to be an idea in itself. It is never meant to be just a desire for improvement.

“There may not be a reason for saying something until after it has been said”

Movement is obtained in a variety of ways:

*   Extracting the principle of an idea
*   Following the moment-to-moment consequences
*   Focusing on the difference from the usual
*   Spelling out the positive aspects
*   You can extract a concept and then work with this.
*   You can focus on the difference between the provocation and the usual situation.
*   You can pick out the positive aspects and work with these.
*   You can imagine the provocation put into action and see what happens.

Escape

Focus on things we take for granted and wonder whether they are indeed the only or best way of doing things. E.g. A restaurant without chairs

It is difficult to identify those things we take for granted. To obtain those we can try:

*   Dropping a feature
*   Altering a feature
*   Finding an alternative way of achieving the same end

Reversal

Here we take a normal relationship and reverse it. Filters are there to remove some of the tar in cigarettes. &#039;Po, we add something instead of removing it.&#039;

Distortion

Here there is a change in a sequence or a change in relationships. Normally, you pick up the phone, dial the number and speak. &#039;Po, you speak before you dial.&#039; This can lead to two ideas. The first is voice-activated dialing – which exists. The second idea is to build a simple tape recorder into the phone.

Exaggeration

This is an exaggeration, upwards or downwards of any dimension. Po, telephone calls can only last two minutes.&#039; This suggests a compression technique so that you can talk at a normal speed, but the transmitted message is compressed so as to occupy less of the line time. The exaggeration must be unreasonable otherwise it has little provocative effect.

Wishful thinking

The provocation is in the form of &#039;wouldn&#039;t it be nice if . . .&#039;. The provocation must be more than just a desire. It would not be very provocative to say &#039;Po, the trains were always on time&#039;. But it would be provocative to say &#039;Po, you got paid for waiting for a train&#039;.

### Random stimulation method: {#random-stimulation-method}

A random input (word, picture. We may also extract a function from the word (e.g. elephant very large) serves to tap into lines of thought that might otherwise have been hidden. In our thinking we move out of a certain area along the traditional route. If we toss in a random word it has its own associations. Sooner or later these link up with the associations of the problem we are trying to solve.

### Information and thinking {#information-and-thinking}

It is only our lack of complete information that makes it necessary for us to think. The more information we have the better will our thinking be and the more appropriate our actions. There are several areas where we can never have complete information one of those is the future.

Information is no substitute for thinking and vice versa.

#### CAF Consider All Factors {#caf-consider-all-factors}

Think about all factors related to the problem. The emphasis is on “What has been left out?” and “What else should be consider?”

#### C &amp; S {#c-s}

Consider the consequences of an action or decision. Timeframes below can be adjusted to suit the problem at hand. The different time zones are focused upon on turn (like for PMI)

1.  Immediate consequences &lt; 1 year
2.  Short-term 1-5 years
3.  Medium-term 5-20 years
4.  Long-term &gt;20 years

#### Dense reading and dense listening {#dense-reading-and-dense-listening}

Good listener:

*   Listens slowly
*   Does not jump ahead nor does he rush to judge or already formulate his own reply
*   Focusses on what is being said
*   Listens to the words between the words

Good reading is like good listening, reading between the lines and wondering why something has been expressed in a particular way.

#### Questions {#questions}

Ask the right questions. Shooting questions (focused questions where we know what we are aiming at and Fishing questions (more open questions))

Negative information is important. In some cases negative information can help to exclude a whole range of possibilities.

#### **_Fi-Fo_** {#fi-fo}

Survey of info that is already available and that which is still required.

**Information In:** The info already available is examined carefully. All the implications and logical inferences are extracted from it.

**Information Out:** The gaps in the information are examined, defined and spelled out.

### Thinking methodology {#thinking-methodology}

#### Clash system {#clash-system}

Western civilization has developed the clash system in which two opposing views fight it out. This covers argument, debate. The method is used in politics, courts, business decisions and other day to day living areas.

Disadvantages of the clash system:

*   As one side attacks and the other defends each point of view grows more rigid
*   One or the other point will eventually prevail
    *   The other group is bitter and unwilling to make the new system work
*   In order to change something an existing idea must be attacked and shown to be inadequate

#### Eclectics {#eclectics}

Seeks to pull out of the situation what is of value – no matter on which side it is to be found. There are no opposing ideas to begin with. There is joint listening and joint exploration. It is only later that ideas start to emerge. We accept possibilities lay them out in parallel and then seek to design forwards.

EBS Examine both sides

What is really the other point of view? The exploration is neutral. Participants are encouraged to explore both sides in such a way that from listening to their points you would be unable to tell which point view they actually favor.

Doing an EBS does not exclude the holding of a point of view, but this comes after the exploration not before it.

ADI Agreement, Disagreement Irrelevance

The two sides are compared (from EBS) and the areas of agreement are noted. Next the areas of disagreement are noted and finally the areas of irrelevance. In a difficult situation it might be better if for each party strongly holding an opinion to do an ADI on its own.

It often turns out that this neutral exploration shows that the areas of disagreement might be quite small compared to how large they appear in the argument situation. Isolation the area of disagreement means that it can be further examined in order to find out how basic the disagreement might be.

Logic bubble

A logic bubble is that bubble of perception within which a person is acting. The bubble includes perception of circumstances, structure, context and relationship. In any situation it is useful to map out the logic bubbles of the other people involved.

OPV other people`s view

In using the tool the thinker tries to put himself in the other person`s shoes in order to look at the world from that position. This involves the identification of the other people involved in a situation.

Doing an OPV does not mean putting into the mouths of all parties sane and rational arguments of the sort one might hold oneself. Nor does it mean putting into their mouths complaints and irrationality in order to condemn their point of view. It means trying to look objectively at the world from the other points of view.

Thinking and/vs. emotions/gut feeling

Three possible ways in which thinking/perception can interact with emotions.

1.  Blind emotion: Emotion is present from the beginning even before the particular situation is encountered. This may happen with jealousy, hatred or aggression.
2.  With our perception we examine the situation briefly. We recognize some pattern and that switches on our emotion. From then on our further perception is narrowed and channeled by that emotion.
3.  Broad and calm exploration of the situation and in the end emotions come in to make the final decision and choose the course of action.

Values are the links between events and our emotions they convert events into matters about which we feel strongly.

### HV and LV High values and low values {#hv-and-lv-high-values-and-low-values}

Divide the values occurring in a situation into high and low values. High values are the one that determine action and the low values are the ones which have to be taken into account. The examination of values is an awareness exercise. It is a matter of becoming aware of the values that are inherent in a situation the conflict of values as they are perceived by the people involved and the source of these values. Pull out the value laden words from a written or verbal conversation.

### Six thinking hats {#six-thinking-hats}

**Parallel thinking**

Imagine a rather ornate building of a square shape. There are four people, each of whom is facing one aspect of this building. Through a mobile phone or walkie-talkie, each person is insisting and arguing that he or she is facing the most beautiful aspect of the building.

Parallel thinking means that they change how they go about this argument. All four people move around to the south side of the building together. Then all of them move on to the west side. Then the north and finally the east side. So all of them, in parallel, are looking at the same side of the building at any one moment.

Instead of argument, where A is adversarially attacking B, we have a system where A and B are both looking and thinking in the same direction – but the directions change as they move around. That is parallel thinking.

Method:

There is no fixed order of use. You can choose the sequence you want. In training, some of the more useful sequences will be suggested.

#### Blue Hat {#blue-hat}

This is the organizing or control hat. It is rather like the conductor of an orchestra. It is used right at the beginning of a discussion to decide the focus and what sequence of hats to use. During the meeting the chairperson or facilitator metaphorically wears the Blue Hat in a disciplinary way. People are reminded of the hat in use if they stray from that mode. The Blue Hat is used at the end for the outcome, summary and next steps.

#### White Hat {#white-hat}

Think of white and paper and printout. The White Hat is concerned with information. What information do we have? What information is missing? What information do we need – and how are we going to get it? Questions can be asked under the White Hat. If conflicting information is put forward, there is no argument. Both versions are put down in parallel and then discussed when that information needs to be used.

#### Red Hat {#red-hat}

Think of red and fire and warmth. The Red Hat is to do with feelings, emotions, intuition. Under the Red Hat all participants are invited to put forward their feelings. In a normal discussion you can only put forward these things if they are disguised as logic. Here there is no need to justify or explain them. They exist and can therefore be put forward. The Red Hat period is very brief and simply allows these things to be put forward.

#### Black Hat {#black-hat}

Think of the black of a judge&#039;s robes. The Black Hat is for critical thinking. What is wrong with the idea? What are its weaknesses? The Black Hat looks at the down side, why something will not work, the risks and dangers. All the negative comments that might be made during a meeting are concentrated under the Black Hat. The Black Hat is very useful, possibly the most useful of all the hats, but it has its defined place.

#### Yellow Hat {#yellow-hat}

Think of sunshine and optimism, dawn and a new day. This focuses on the positive. What are the benefits? The values? How could it be done? Education is mostly about critical thinking. We never really develop &#039;value sensitivity&#039;. This means the ability to find value in anything – even things we do not like and will not use. Nevertheless we should, honestly and objectively, find value in such things. Without value sensitivity, creativity can be a waste of time. I have sat in on meetings where good ideas have been generated but no one has been able to see the value of the ideas.

#### Green Hat {#green-hat}

Think of vegetation, growth and branches. This is directly concerned with creativity. When the Green Hat is in use, participants are expected to make a creative effort or keep quiet. They do not like keeping quiet so they make that effort. This means looking for new ideas. It means considering alternatives, both the obvious ones and new ones. It means generating possibilities. It means modifying and changing a suggested idea, possibly through the deliberate use of lateral thinking tools.
