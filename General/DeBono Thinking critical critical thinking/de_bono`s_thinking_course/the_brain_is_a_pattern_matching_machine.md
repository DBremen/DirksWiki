## The brain is a pattern matching machine {#the-brain-is-a-pattern-matching-machine}

The mind works to make sense of confusion and uncertainty. It works to recognize familiar patterns, once such a pattern is recognized the mind switches into it and follows it along (further thinking is unnecessary). It works somewhat similar to driving a car. As soon as you hit a familiar road you can stop using the map/asking for directions . Our thinking continuously searches for those familiar roads that make thinking unnecessary.

Once a pattern has been formed the mind no longer has to analyze or sort information. All that is required is enough information to trigger the pattern. The mind then follows along the pattern automatically in the same way as a driver follows a familiar road.

Unless there are competing patterns then anything remotely similar to the established pattern will be treated as if it were that pattern.
