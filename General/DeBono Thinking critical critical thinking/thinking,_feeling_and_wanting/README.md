# Thinking, feeling and wanting {#thinking-feeling-and-wanting}

**It is important to recognize that the mind is composed of three functions:**

*   **Thinking**
*   **Feeling**
*   **Desiring (or wanting)**

Wherever one of these functions is present, the other two are present as well. And these three functions are continually influencing and being influenced by one another. Our thinking influences our feelings and desires. Our feelings influence our thinking and desires. Our desires influence our thinking and feeling. **We cannot immediately change our desires or feelings. It is only thinking that we have direct access to.** It makes no sense for someone to order you to feel what you do not feel or to desire what you do not desire. We do not change feelings by substituting other feelings, or desires by substituting other desires. But someone can suggest that we consider a new way to think. We can role-play new thoughts, but not new emotions or desires. It is possible to reason within a point of view with which we do not agree. **By rethinking our thinking, we may change our thinking. When our thinking changes, our feelings and desires will shift in accordance with our thinking.**
