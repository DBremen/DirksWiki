## Changing irrational behavior grounded in irrational desires or motivations {#changing-irrational-behavior-grounded-in-irrational-desires-or-motivations}

1.  Identify the questionable behavior (behavior that is getting you in trouble, causing problems for you, or causing problems for someone else).
2.  Identify the precise thinking leading to that behavior. What is the thinking that is generating the motivation to act in this manner?
3.  Analyze the extent to which the thinking is justified, without leaving out any significant relevant information.
4.  If the thinking is irrational, develop thinking that would be reasonable in this situation.
5.  Actively attack the unreasonable thinking with reasonable thinking.
