# True love is the apple of Eden {#true-love-is-the-apple-of-eden}

It seems ironic that when people fall in love, no justification for their attachment is necessary. It is accepted that the process by which we are drawn to another is mysterious and beyond explanation.

The people around them accept this and go ahead with the elaborate and expensive ceremony that will celebrate the beginning of their lives together. When, on the other hand, people fall out of love, the demands for an explanation are insistent: What happened? Who’s at fault? Why couldn’t you work it out? “We didn’t love each other anymore” is not, in most cases, a sufficient response.
