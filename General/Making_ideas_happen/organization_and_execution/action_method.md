## Action Method {#action-method}

Everything in life is a project, and every project must be broken down into Action Steps, References, and Backburner Items. Prioritization should help us maintain both incremental progress as well as momentum for our long-term objectives.

| **Current focus level per project** |
| --- |
| **High** | **Medium** | **Low** | **Idle** |
| Project 1 | Project 2 |  | Project 3 |
| Project 6 |  |  |  |

1.  **Action Items**

Are the specific, concrete tasks that inch you forward: redraft and send the memo, post the blog entry, pay the electricity bill, etc.

*   Capture Action Items everywhere
*   Separate urgent from important items
*   List with items to get done today
*   Break-down bigger items into smaller manageable action items
*   Separate action items from emails, references
*   Create follow-up action items for delegated items
*   Actions are truly “delegated” only when they are accepted.
*   Evaluate
    *   What can be done quickly vs. what needs to be tracked over time by a project
    *   What can be done by you vs. needs to be delegated
*   Assign due date

1.  **References**

Are any project-related handouts, sketches, notes, meeting minutes, manuals, Web sites, or ongoing discussions that you may want to refer back to. It is important to note that References are not actionable—they are simply there for reference when focusing on any particular project.

*   Try to reduce # of references
*   Keep only important items that are needed

1.  **Parking lot items**

Things that are not actionable now but maybe someday. Perhaps it is an idea for a client for which there is no budget yet. Or maybe it is something you intend to do in a particular project at an unforeseen time in the future.

*   Review items on a regular basis
    *   Convert relevant into action items
    *   Remove irrelevant items
*   Keep general parking lot or per project

### Seek constraints {#seek-constraints}

Brilliant creative minds become more focused and actionable when the realm of possibilities is defined and, to some extent, restricted. Of course, when you limit the realm of possibilities too much—by allowing too little time or budget—you will have to lower expectations for the outcome. The goal is to find the right balance, so that you can feed off the project’s parameters rather than feel frustrated or unduly constrained.
