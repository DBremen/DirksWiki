Happiness is its own reward. At Zappos, happiness serves as a form of compensation without limits or tangible costs. Not only is it a core value of the culture, but it frees up financial resources that can be used in other ways—perhaps to lower prices for customers or pay for free overnight shipping. Happiness is the company’s most valuable currency. As you push ideas forward, you should make use of alternative rewards that keep you —and your team—engaged with your long-term pursuits. The traditional methods for acknowledging progress—financial rewards and celebrity am ong them—are unlikely tobe available to you in the early stages of making ideas happen. Putting an emphasis on happiness changes the types of goals you pursue as well as how you hire and manage people along the way.
