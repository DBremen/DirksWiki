## Feedback via appreciations {#feedback-via-appreciations}

Appreciations is a technique that is used to improve students’ skills without any demoralizing consequences. It’s a unique form of feedback that helps to focus on developing strengths. Here’s the concept behind appreciations: having just shared a story (or, in other contexts, a presentation or idea), you go around and ask people to comment on the elements they most appreciated. The exchange of appreciations is meant to help you build upon your strengths, with the underlying assumption that a creative craft is made extraordinary through developing your strengths rather than obsessing over your weaknesses. **If our eyes are always looking for weakness, we begin to lose the intuition to notice the beauty. Institute a round of appreciation-based refinement with your team prior to your formal process of critique. Your projects—and the skills of your colleagues—will be refined more organically by doing so. This change in the process of feedback exchange will not only improve output but also enrich the team’s chemistry.**
