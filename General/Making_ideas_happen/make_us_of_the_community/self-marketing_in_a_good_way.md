## Self-marketing in a good way {#self-marketing-in-a-good-way}

A good self-marketing strategy should start with intrinsic interests that can become personal projects—projects that demonstrate your strengths. As your strengths become utilized, people will start to respect you for something that is real—something that is earned.

**The ability to gather and present your past accomplishments visually in a “show, don’t tell” framework is much more effective than having a list of clients or distributing a resumé.**

**Identify your differentiating attributes.** Self-marketing should start with identifying the strengths that differentiate you from others.

**Develop a communications strategy.** Be introspective and advocate for the unique perspective that you bring to every project and problem. People will likely respect the efforts you take and the decisions you make when they understand the source of your strengths and ambitions. While at work, you might **consider volunteering for internal or side projects that will best showcase your strengths and take full advantage of your differentiating attributes.**
