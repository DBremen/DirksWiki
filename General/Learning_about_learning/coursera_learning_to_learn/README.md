*   The better you get at something the more you can enjoy it
*   Diffuse mode
    *   (more big picture thinking (lots of space between the bumpers in the pinball analogy))
*   Try taking a &quot;picture walk&quot; through the material to gain big picture context before diving into the detail
*   Focused mode (focused attention, step by step, small spaces between the bumpers)
*   Hard practice makes for better understanding and better retention of information
*   Recall from memory
*   Practicing the hard stuff (don’t overdo the easy things)
*   Mini tests (coding challenges)
*   Interleaving with different kinds of information or practicing in different ways/in different environments
*   Use pen and paper rather than digital
*   Use breaks
*   Building chunks (connected pieces of information)
    *   Focused attention
    *   Understanding (basic idea rather than 100%)
        *   Sometimes it’s better to move on in order to understand the big picture
    *   Practice
*   There is a bottom up chunking process where practice and repetition can help you both build and strengthen each chunk, so you can easily gain access to it when needed.
*   There is a top down “big picture” process that allows you to see where what you are learning fits in.
*   Chunking may involve your learning how to use a certain problem solving technique. Context means learning when to use that technique instead of some other technique
