## R -mode to L-mode ﬂow {#r-mode-to-l-mode-ow}

**Add sensory experience to engage more of your brain.**

For instance, try ﬁddling with a paper clip or some sort of tactile puzzle while stuck on a tedious conference call or while pondering a tricky problem. When you involve an additional input mode, you are activating more areas of the brain—you’re bringing more processing power online, as it were.

What we need is a better way of synchronizing our L-mode and R -mode processing so that the whole mind can work better and more efﬁciently. Example rock climbing lessons where the instructor first let the participants climb for 30 minutes before starting the formal lecture. He ﬁrst presented a multisensory, experiential context so that participants could “get our heads around it,” as it were. Then he followed up with a more traditional, fact-ﬁlled lecture.

Don’t be in such a hurry. When problem solving, learn to be comfortable with uncertainty. When creating, be comfortable with the absurd and the impractical. When learning, don’t try so hard to learn and memorize; just get “used to it” ﬁrst. Try to understand the meaning ﬁrst; get the overall gist of it. Then follow up with traditional L-mode activities to get to the next step: an R -mode to L-mode ﬂow.

**Metaphor, a common ground for both verbalizations and images, is a way to voyage back and forth between the subconscious and conscious, between right and left hemispheres.**

Metaphor comes from the Greek meaning “to transfer,” with the idea that you are transferring the properties of one object to another in a way that is not literally possible.

**Trust ink over memory; every mental read is a write.**

Instead, augment your memory with some kind of reality check. Whether it’s notes that you keep or a conversation with someone else with their own memories, you need something to help keep your memories from drifting too far from reality.
