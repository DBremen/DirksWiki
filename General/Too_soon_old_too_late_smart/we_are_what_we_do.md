# We are what we do {#we-are-what-we-do}

Past behavior is the most reliable predictor of future behaviour

In general we get, not what we deserve, but what we expect

The three components of happiness are something useful to do, someone to love, and something to look forward to.

We love someone when the importance of his or her needs and desires rises to the level of our own.

The point is that love is demonstrated behaviorally.
