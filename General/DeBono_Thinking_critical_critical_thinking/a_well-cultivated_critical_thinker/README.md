# A well-cultivated critical thinkerâ€¦ {#a-well-cultivated-critical-thinker}

*   raises vital questions and problems, formulating them clearly and precisely;
*   gathers and assesses relevant information, and effectively interprets it;
*   comes to well-reasoned conclusions and solutions, testing them against relevant criteria and standards
*   thinks open mindedly within alternative systems of thought, recognizing and assessing, as need be, their assumptions, implications, and practical consequences; and
*   Communicates effectively with others in figuring out solutions to complex problems.

**Critical thinking is, in short, self-directed, self-disciplined, self-monitored, and self-corrective thinking. It presupposes assent to rigorous standards of excellence and mindful command of their use. It entails effective communication and problem-solving abilities.**

**Critical thinking adds a second level of thinking to ordinary thinking. The second level analyzes and assesses our ordinary thinking.**

**First-Order-Thinking:**

It is spontaneous and non-reflective. It contains insight, prejudice, truth and error, good and bad reasoning, all combined

**Second-Order-Thinking:**

Is first-order-thinking raised to the level of conscious realization (analyzed, addressed, and reconstructed)

*   **We can develop in such a way that we learn to see mistakes in our own thinking, as well as the thinking of others**
*   **Or we can merely develop some proficiency in making our opponent&#039;s thinking look bad.**
*   **Typically, people see mistakes in other&#039;s thinking without being able to credit the strengths in those opposing views.**

This kind of thinking fails to consider, in good faith, viewpoints that contradict its own viewpoint. It lacks **fair-mindedness**. Instead:

*   **Work to understand and appreciate the viewpoints of others.**
*   **Be willing to listen to arguments you do not necessarily hold.**
*   **Change your views when faced with better reasoning.**
*   **Question your own purposes, evidence, conclusions, implications, and points of view with the same vigor that we question those of others.**

**Fair-mindedness** entails a consciousness of the need to treat all viewpoints alike, without reference to one&#039;s own feelings or selfish interests, or the feelings or selfish interests of one&#039;s friends, company, community, or nation. It implies adherence to intellectual standards (such as accuracy and sound logic), uninfluenced by one&#039;s own advantage or the advantage of one&#039;s group.

**Intellectual humility** (opposite of intellectual arrogance) may be defined as having a consciousness of the limits of one&#039;s knowledge, including a sensitivity to circumstances in which one&#039;s native egocentrism is likely to function self-deceptively. This entails being aware of one&#039;s biases, one&#039;s prejudices, the limitations of one&#039;s viewpoint, and the extent of one&#039;s ignorance. Intellectual humility depends on recognizing that one should not claim more than one actually knows. It does not imply spinelessness or submissiveness. It implies the lack of intellectual pretentiousness, boastfulness, or conceit, combined with insight into the logical foundations, or lack of such foundations, of one&#039;s beliefs.

**Intellectual courage** may be defined as having a consciousness of the need to face and fairly address ideas, beliefs, or viewpoints toward which one has strong negative emotions and to which one has not given a serious hearing. Intellectual courage is connected to the recognition that ideas that society considers dangerous or absurd are sometimes rationally justified (in whole or in part). Conclusions and beliefs inculcated in people are sometimes false or misleading. To determine for oneself what makes sense, one must not passively and uncritically accept what one has learned. Intellectual courage comes into play here because there is some truth in some ideas considered dangerous and absurd, and distortion or falsity in some ideas strongly held by social groups to which we belong. People need courage to be fair-minded thinkers in these circumstances. The penalties for nonconformity can be severe.
