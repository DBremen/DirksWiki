## The Elements of Thought in Relationship {#the-elements-of-thought-in-relationship}

### Our purpose affects the manner in which we ask questions (What is our purpose?) {#our-purpose-affects-the-manner-in-which-we-ask-questions-what-is-our-purpose}

All reasoning has a purpose.

*   Take time to state your purpose clearly.
*   Choose significant and realistic purposes.
*   Distinguish your purpose from related purposes.
*   Make sure your purpose is fair in context (that it doesn&#039;t involve violating the rights of others).
*   Check periodically to be sure you are still focused on your purpose and haven&#039;t wandered from your target.

### The manner in which we ask questions affects the information we gather (What is the key question here?) {#the-manner-in-which-we-ask-questions-affects-the-information-we-gather-what-is-the-key-question-here}

All reasoning is an attempt to figure out something, to settle some question, solve some problem.

*   Take time to clearly and precisely state the question at issue.
*   Express the question in several ways to clarify its meaning and scope.
*   Break the question into sub-questions (when you can).
*   Identify the type of question you are dealing with (historical, economic, biological, etc.) and whether the question has one right answer, is a matter of mere opinion, or require reasoning from more than one point of view.
*   Think through the complexities of the question (think deeply through the question).

### The information we gather affects the way we interpret it (What data do we need to make this decision?): {#the-information-we-gather-affects-the-way-we-interpret-it-what-data-do-we-need-to-make-this-decision}

All reasoning is based on data, information, and evidence.

*   Restrict your claims to those supported by the data you have. Search for information that opposes your position as well as information that supports it.
*   Make sure that all information used is clear, accurate, and relevant to the question at issue.
*   Make sure you have gathered sufficient information.
*   Make sure, especially, that you have considered all significant information relevant to the issue.

### The way we interpret information affects the way we conceptualize it (Is there another way to interpret these data?): {#the-way-we-interpret-information-affects-the-way-we-conceptualize-it-is-there-another-way-to-interpret-these-data}

All reasoning is expressed through, and shaped by, concepts and ideas.

*   Clearly identify key concepts.
*   Consider alternative concepts or alternative definitions for concepts.
*   Make sure you are using concepts with care and precision.
*   Use concepts justifiably (not distorting their established meanings).

### The way we conceptualize information affects the assumptions we make (Do we need to question that? What other points of view do we need to consider?): {#the-way-we-conceptualize-information-affects-the-assumptions-we-make-do-we-need-to-question-that-what-other-points-of-view-do-we-need-to-consider}

All reasoning is done from some point of view.

*   Clearly identify your point of view.
*   Seek other relevant points of view and identify their strengths as well as weaknesses.
*   Strive to be fair-minded in evaluating all points of view.

### The assumptions we make affect the implications that follow from our thinking (What are we taking for granted here?): {#the-assumptions-we-make-affect-the-implications-that-follow-from-our-thinking-what-are-we-taking-for-granted-here}

All reasoning is based on assumptions.

*   Clearly identify your assumptions and determine whether they are justifiable.
*   Consider how your assumptions are shaping your point of view.

### The implications that follow from our thinking affect the way we see things, our point of view: {#the-implications-that-follow-from-our-thinking-affect-the-way-we-see-things-our-point-of-view}

All reasoning contains inferences or interpretations by which we draw conclusions and give meaning to data.

*   Infer only what the evidence implies.
*   Check inferences for their consistency with each other.
*   Identify assumptions that lead you to your inferences.
*   Make sure your inferences logically follow from the information.

All reasoning leads somewhere or has implications and consequences.

*   Trace the logical implications and consequences that follow from your reasoning.
*   Search for negative as well as positive implications.
*   Consider all possible significant consequences.
