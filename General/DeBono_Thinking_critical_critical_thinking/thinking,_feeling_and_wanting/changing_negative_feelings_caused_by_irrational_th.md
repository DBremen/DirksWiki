## Changing negative feelings caused by irrational thinking {#changing-negative-feelings-caused-by-irrational-thinking}

1.  Identify a feeling you have experienced that you suspect might be irrational (a feeling such as irritability, resentment, arrogance, or depression).
2.  What thinking would account for the feeling? There may be more than one possibility here. If so, figure out which possibility is most likely.
3.  Determine the extent to which the thinking is reasonable. Pay close attention to the reasons you give to justify the thinking. Is it possible that these are not your actual reasons? Can you think of any other motives you might have? Consider alternative interpretations of the situation.
4.  If you conclude that the feeling is irrational, express precisely why you think so.
5.  Construct thinking that would represent a rational response in the situation. Actively attack the irrational thinking with the thinking that is rational. Actively rehearse the thinking that represents a rational response.
