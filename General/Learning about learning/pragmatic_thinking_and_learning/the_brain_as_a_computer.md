## The brain as a computer {#the-brain-as-a-computer}

if CPU #1 is hogging the bus, CPU #2 can’t get at memory to perform searches. Similarly, if CPU #2 is cranking away on a high-priority search, CPU #1 cannot get at memory either. They interfere with each other.

**R -mode Sees Forest; L-mode Sees Trees**

### L-Mode {#l-mode}

CPU #1 is probably the most familiar to you: it is chieﬂy responsible for linear, logical thought, and language processing. CPU #1 is relatively slow and uses a relatively small amount of overall brain real estate. It’s programmed with an “idle loop” routine as well. If CPU #1 is not processing anything else, it will simply generate an internal stream of verbal chatter. It’s that little voice in your head.

### R-Mode {#r-mode}

CPU #2 is more like a magic digital signal processor. It’s your brain’s answer to Google: think of it like a super regular-expression search engine, responsible for searching and pattern matching. **As such, it might grab matching patterns that aren’t obviously related. It can go off searching while you are “thinking” of something else and return a result set asynchronously—and possibly days later. Since CPU #2 doesn’t do any verbal processing, that means its results aren’t verbal, either.**

It can retrieve and recognize verbal elements, but it can’t do anything with them by itself because of that memory bus contention between L-mode and R -mode. For instance, have you ever had the experience of trying to describe a dream when you ﬁrst wake up? Many times it seems that a crystal-clear, vivid dream evaporates from your memory as soon as you try to describe it in words. That’s because the images, feelings, and overall experience are R -mode things: your dream was generated in R -mode. As you try to put your dream into words, you experience a sort of bus contention. L-mode takes over the bus, and now you can’t get at those memories anymore. In effect, they aren’t verbalizable.

You have amazing perceptual powers, many of which can’t be effectively put into words. For instance, you can instantly recognize the faces of a large number of familiar people. It doesn’t matter whether they’ve changed their hairstyle, changed their manner of dress, or put on ten pounds or twenty years. But try to describe the face of even your closest loved one. How do you put that recognition ability into words? Can you make a database describing the faces of the people you know in such a way that you could recognize them based on that description?

R -mode is quite diligent at storing input. In fact, it’s possible that every experience you have, no matter how mundane, is stored. But it is not necessarily indexed.

Researchers in Japan did a study of a bank’s ATM interfaces; subjects found the aesthetically pleasing button layouts much easier to use than the ugly ones, even though the functionality and workﬂow was the same.

Positive emotions are essential to learning and creative thinking. Being “happy” broadens your thought processes and brings more of the brain’s hardware online.

Creativity comes from the selection and assembly of just the right components in just the right presentation to create the work. And selection—knowing what to select and in what context—comes from pattern matching.
